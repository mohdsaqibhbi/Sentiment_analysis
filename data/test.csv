Just my 2 cents:
 When I say """"I weigh 87 kg"""" I am abusing the word """"weight"""" to mean that my mass is 87 kg. I'm not abusing the word """"kilogram"""" to mean that the Earth pulls me down with 0.85 kN. I am not willing to look at each revision of that intro paragraph (with my 56K connection it'd take me more time than it'd be worth), but the revision of 27 October (""""In everyday usage, the mass of an object in kilograms is often referred to as its weight, although strictly speaking the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it, measured in newtons (see also kilogram-force)."""") seems quite correct to me. 
 Most of the section """"Mass versus weight"""" doesn't belong to an article about an unit of measurement. If it did, it would belong to the article about the pound, and so on. The mention of the kilogram-force is relevant, but I'd prefer all the rest to go to the Weight article, if anywhere.  """,0,0,0

"Please re-consider once again, Im not sure if its appropiate for me to discuss this here, let me know if its not, I dont want to break any rules.
I investigated the following in hopes to get a better resolution, I dont feel like the external links page shouldn't include the following if my site is not allowed because they contain the exact same things as my site, also, just because I am the owner of the site and am adding it, what would be the difference if I acted like I wasnt the owner? I I have only one link to the graffiti store once you enter the site, and its nowhere on the gallery or the top navigation, but just because I have a store doesnt mean I was posting my site in order to promote it, I was certainly not, or else I would of tried to add the store url when I added the other url. Also like I said before, my site has been up since 1997 off a different domain, and since 1999 off the current domain. We are ranked 5 on google, and get plenty of hits on our own, I was not trying to add my site here to receive more hits. PureGraffiti.com is going to be online for as long as the internet is alive, the gallery will be the biggest gallery of graffiti art online, weather one agrees with me or not, you can take a look at the stats and figure it out yourself. We are online for Graffiti Artists that dont have the knowledge or money to get their pictures up on a website that is already established and well known by almost everyone in the USA that is a Graffiti Artist. The store we have merely pays for the dedicated server bill costs to keep this huge site alive, and there are 500 other stores online that do advertize on google and other sites, we on the other hand dont. We also dont charge for the webspace, and we also dont have advertizing for money on our site in hopes to make money of our viewers like many of the sites you have accepted.

Please take all this into consideration:

http://www.Artcimes.org = first graffiti site. They have a store as well, and they have advertizing for money all through-out their site. Just because they are the first graffiti site, doesnt give them any special treatment. 
http://www.bombing.org = Advertizing for money all over the site
http://writers.org.ua = advertizing for money pop-up when visited the site.

P.S. By no means I have a problem with these sites, however, I do think it is unfair that they get to be on there when my site is the same, and does not contain advertizements to make money.

Thank you once again.

No problem, and I think many people appreciate a user saying """"job well done.""""  The commenting feature of HTML (the bracket exclamation point business) makes text invisible.  For instance, if you were to look at """"edit this page"""" you could see a sentence here: .   This is occasionally done in articles for a variety of reasons:
Put in a notice about vandalism (such as is done on Chuck Norris, which is also, at present, semi-protected), or when the same mistake is made by many users,
Automated bots sometimes also """"remove"""" an image by enclosing it in comments, when the image may be added incorrectly.
In rare cases, text additions are put in comments so that other editors can see them, before the material is added to the article properly.  This is usually a bad use of the comments, since it makes things confusing to edit.
They often appear at the end of semi-automated template messages, to indicate which message was used (that is where the """"Template:Unsigned"""").  So, for instance, I wrote {{subst:unsigned|00 tux}}, and the unsigned template was added.

The above CIA/UN map just gives general information of where the Tajiks and Hazara live. According to me, it is as accurate as it can be. About the Pashtuns living on the border with Iran, this is nothing new. All that area is inhabited by Pashtuns since before Afghanistan was created as a nation in 1747. In fact, I just saw a map shown on TV of Afghanistan on the new English al-Jazeera channel, and it showed Pashtuns covering the same area as the one above. Perhaps this disturbed you for some reason but it shows what's out there in the western area of Afghanistan. If you keep removing my map I will bring an administrator to help resolve the issue.

Once the discussion is over, I will republish the article with the changes I made and we will all have to leave in peace this article if those among you who censored my useful contribution are capable of such a normal behaviour (I very much doubt it!).

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned.

 what part of """"leave d15b8 alone"""" do people not understand?? 

Great, now we have a kangaroo hopping around in business that is also not his. (before my tachometer redlines, i'll say that Mr. Men At Work in Australia, i understand you, but i don't have the time to deal with your well-worded comments. just know that you shouldn't have spoken up. this is not a """"wiki policy"""" or theory or tight-assed protocol issue for me -> i'm only interested in the clarity of engine B8).
Ok. Does anyone see how ridiculous this is? The d15b8, an engine that nobody really cared about - a USDM-ONLY engine from 20 years ago, which non-Americans COULD NOT HAVE - is all of the sudden attracting attention in 2012 from foreign nationals, which have no knowledge whatsoever about the D15B8! And what's worse, they are INTERVENING?? This is like me telling an Australian the way I think 'Vejemite' should be spelled, and then deleting it. Me telling a Swede that 'Surstroming' [citation needed] doesn't need two dots above the vowel, nor does it need two M's. 
Children, you CANNOT rightfully remove/edit unless you TRULY and GENUINELY know the additions are incorrect. In this case you do NOT. So leave it be. If you think the information MAY need correction, then wait. Wait for another d15b8 expert to edit it. Eventually it will come. Otherwise LEAVE IT ALONE. This is how Wiki works. It's not feasible to add """"citation needed"""" to every damn sentence of data. You two dogmatic dorks really need to get girlfriends and spend some time with them. Tell them you love them. Buy them shoes. They like that attention. Get outside more. Give a street beggar a kroner. It's unthinkable that you are wasting everyone's time. Stop seeing yourself as the internet police. Stop seeing yourself as Wiki watchdogs. Get a life. As for my education, I don't claim to know about the D15B3, or the B4, or the B5. But I do know about the B8 (and a little about the z1, which I made additions to and were LEFT ALONE because most REAL PEOPLE people believed them to be correct).
Now, can everyone (EVERYONE) who doesn't know about the Honda """"D15B8"""" engine just p-i-s-s  o-f-f!??

Grrrrr, you guys [mostly Nose-to-the-clouds-choppers-citation-needed guy] really upset me. I don't mess with your additions; why mess with mine?

""": FOR THE RECORD. Danny, you love to weave more straw men and avoid the real issues at all cost, as you have just beautifully demonstrated. As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a """" hog and pig"""" in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: """"As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue"""". I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.

YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is """"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body"""" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)

I am confused here.  I posted something about both of the publically funded Waldorf schools in Sonoma County, not an 'individual school,' and that information comes from official sources (so it is properly sourced), and the information provides information which contradicts the 'Official' Waldorf position.  I do not believe that the 'official' statement of the Waldorf committee reflects their reality.  Anti-immunization is so highly correlated with the Waldorf schools I have looked at as to be close to official policy.  Waldorf schools in the US  education as practiced in the US includes a substantial anti-immunization    

 Concerns over immunizations

This page http://www.waldorfanswers.org/QuestionsMore.htm refers to a growing anti-immunization movement within and outside of Waldorf schools, but again refers to the same dead link as the 'consensus statement' on vaccinations.

The article does not cite a verifiable source on the policy of Waldorf education towards vaccinations.  The article does say """"Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an """"anthroposophic lifestyle"""" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination""""  Which is a deep violation of NPOV - to assert a correlation when there is a deep selection bias in the cited studies.

I will replace the immunization section with something sourced unless it is properly sourced.""",0,0,0

Whilst I don't agree with your reasoning, I am happy to add my """"reference"""" to Further Reading rather than References. It is not really self-promotion to add an worthy but out-of-print book as further reading for those interested in the subjects. Certainly less self promotional than some of the press references which are basically just PR releases given spurious credibility by being recycled in the mainstream press. Sadly, much of what passes for journalism today is just PR stuff, which begs the question of how seriously we should take a lot of references!   

Well I might dabble in such edits, if I had more time. To be honest, I don't give tuppence whether my books are mentioned or not. It is of no advantage whatsoever to me, commercial or egotistical. I merely thought I was helping but clearly have transgressed Wiki's arcane guidelines, often inconsistent from what I can see. And to be honest, I do believe that people may have used my book without true attribution, there are one or two things mentioned that are so obscure that it would be rather a coincidence if they hadn't been read first in my book. Hopefully I'll not be tempted to dabble in Marmite, of which I know a great deal!  

thank you for your comments and help. not meaning to be argumentative, but I do like to get things as straight as I can. One more thing

"""Paul Metz, Chief Test Pilot F-22 in an interview with Karlo Kopp- """"The decision to integrate the technologies of stealth, supercruise, super-maneuverability and sensor fusion was the result of significant advances in each of these areas in the 1970s and 80s. In particular, stealth technology had advanced to the point that high lift, high angle of attack aerodynamic shapes could co-exist with stealth requirements. This was a significant evolution from the first generation stealth aircraft represented by the SR-71 and A-12. Second generation stealth as evidenced by the F-117 had yet to allow aerodynamic efficiency to co-exist with stealth. Only with the third generation of stealth inherent in the B-2 bomber were we able to achieve efficient aerodynamic shapes with a low radar signature."""" http://www.ausairpower.net/API-Metz-Interview.html

Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18. Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. 

Yeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010. I remembered riding one of those D40LF buses on line 115, when SB-5 used to operate that line, shared by SB-18,  which currently owns the line.

This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]

"Of course there is no intellectual property here outside the GFDL license.  If you are unaccustomed to the term ‘intellectual property’, or afraid of it per se, if it strikes terror in your heart or sounds to your ears like an imprecation within Wikipedia context or is too high-flying for Wikipedia, I cannot help you; but please do not impute to me views which I have never articulated and do not hold.  For you are not scoring the rhetorical points at which you aim, but rather reduce the level of discourse to the point which I thought was beneath you — by involving yourself in a tangle of your own making.

The case is very simple.  ‘Violation’ and ‘malfeasance’ involve here the claim of the infringement of Wikipedia guidelines by (two) administrators who, as such (i.e. as administrators), are charged instead with the safeguarding of those very guidelines.  Administrators, yourself included, do not, and cannot, play any role whatever within the Wikipedia scheme other than that of assuring that WP guidelines are implemented and not infringed by the users: there is no scope within the project, as it stands defined at present, for any other additional role that they might even potentially or hypothetically assume.  Even their efforts at protecting the site from vandalism, etc., are only within their purview as guardians of (published) house rules (which, in this case, define vandalism for example in ways differing from those understood by the general public) — nothing, nothing, not an iota more than that.  There is no mechanism here for ‘discretion’, ‘broad’ or otherwise, whereby they could obtain blanket license to violate those guidelines without accountability: the moment that such powers (to dispense with guidelines altogether) are vested in or arrogated by them, (1) they cease to be administrators and become ma-and-pa corner grocery’s owners, with the goods on the shelves their private property to dispose of as they see fit; and (2) Wikipedia ceases to be a community editing project and becomes the private fiefdom of a limited few.  So no, I do not believe you understand that you do not operate here in a vacuum of your own making: I am Wikipedia every bit as much as you are, thank you very much.

You allege that I ‘have misunderstood the essentials of the system’, without specifying wherein that misunderstanding might have consisted in.  You do not have the right to make such unsubstantiated allegations in this forum; those are hits below the belt.  You may say to me, ‘you have claimed xxx, which conflicts with stated policy xxx, and fails to take into consideration the fact that xxx, published here xxx’.  The right to make generalized unsubstantiated allegations amounts to the license to launch personal attacks, a practice that again runs afoul of Wikipedia policies.  You are now violating those policies yourself.  I am not concerned with your tone (whether ‘polite’ or ‘vehement’ and how that impacts my liking or disliking you), but with the substance of what you are saying and how that impacts the project we are both involved in.

I wish to state that your own demeanour here has always struck me as approximating something of a Big Brother from Orwell, a position in part claimed by a kind of doublespeak.  No one, not even the founder, holds here a monopoly on Truth (you might have called it ‘a system of permissions to hold opinions’): all views must be closely argued and fully substantiated, by everyone without exception.

Administrators found guilty of deliberately, with (malice or otherwise) aforethought, violating house rules, and subsequently showing remorseless, unreasonable, unreasoning, defiance to the challenges of such violations (on the strength that ‘I am an administrator and therefore I do not have to account for my actions to you’), must be removed as a matter of principle, and will be removed.  There is no other remedy, as failure to clean the house would amount to allowing it to sink to the lowest common denominator determined by such administrators (and their unaccounted and perhaps unaccountable private reasons which propel them to certain actions).  Enthusiasm for the project and other such factors cannot be sufficient qualification to make someone an administrator here: a certain integrity, a sense of ethics, and a modicum of objectivity (the ability, that is, to see beyond the tip of one’s nose), are also required.  While the fulfilment of these requirements cannot obviously be easily determined beforehand, the discharge of one’s mission as an administrator can be appraised retroactively, and such appraisal should determine whether a user should continue in his/her supervisory capacity.  You wish to protect the administrators accused of wrongdoing now (by failing to answer the facts of the case as requested, but drawing instead all kinds of red herrings out of the hat), from the desire to m",0,0,0

I have several points regarding the recent discussion.  1) I believe that BruceHallman's statement that the phrase """"generally assocatied with the United State's princples and interests"""" conforms to WP:V, WP:NPOV AND WP:NOR is incorrect.  First, I believe that the Heritage foundation source he uses, as pointed out by David Oberst, is not being interperted correctly.  Simply because countries that are rated """"free"""" by Freedom House are generally more supportive of United States interests does not mean that Freedom House's rating are generally associated with United State's intersts.  After all, the long-time US ally Saudi Arabia is treated very harshly by Freedom House.  The summary of the Heritage foundation report does not accurately reflect the assertions in the report which in fact states the opposite, """"As nations become freer, both politically and economically, the policies that they consider to be in their interests become more closely aligned with policies championed by the U.S.not because they are U.S. policies, but because they are policies consistent with the interests of free societies.""""  This means that the verification for that statement is not valid.  In addition, even if it were quoted accurately, the Heritage Foundations stated goal is to """"formulate and promote conservative public policies;"""" they are not a neutral source.  (Indeed, most of the sources for this artical are not neutral sources but are sources with strong bias one way or the other.)  Citing other's opinions, while they are verifiable, does not make them neutral.  
2) BruceHallman is correct, however, in questioning Ultramarine's suggestion that the test of if something is valid is if it reflects how Freedom House describes itself.  Freedom House itself is not a neutral source, and while they may be a good source for some parts of the article (such as when they were founded or who the chairman of their board is) descriptions of their ideology, goals, etc. should probably be cited as """"Freedom House's states"""" etc.  Simply because Freedom House doesn't describe itself a certian way doesn't necessarly mean that it isn't valid.
3) Saying that Freedom House is """"generally associated with US interests"""" isn't necessarly a critisim; however, it is not a statement of fact, either.  Merely the fact that it has been debated so much on this talk page indicates that it is not a verifiable fact, but rather a matter of some contention.  I will outline how I think the article could be better constructed to include the differing opinions of Freedom House in the next bullet point, but I think that the introduction should probably be saved for things that are clearly true, and not things that are up for debate.
4) I feel that if the article is restructured slightly and the primary editors of this article (which, lately, seem to be BruceHallman and Ultramarine, who clearly have different views of Freedom House as an organization) could agree on this structure, it would save a lot of debate.  I think the introduction of the article should state basic, verifiable facts (What they are, where they are headquartered, where they are located, and the fact that they are best known for publishing books).  A statement saying that their political agenda is a matter of contention might also be included to indicate not everyone things that they are all sunshine and roses.  I think the next section should be """"History and Organization"""" and outline when and by whom they were founded, it's organization structure, the fact that the board is mostly American, it's funding, and it's membership in other organization.  I think that the bit about what their activities (both in the historical section and in the organization section with the quote) should be moved to the next section, """"Activities.""""  The Activities (though that is maybe a bad heading) would include the above statements of what Freedom House's claims of prior activities are, the fact that they publish book and details of those books, and the information contained in the """"other activities"""" section.  The final section, I think should be titled something along the lines of """"Political Leanings, Agenda, and Controversy"""" or something, and would be a space for the differing views of Freedom House to be discussed.  The validity (or lack their of) of their ratings, if they are bias in favor of an Ameri-centric point of view, and if they are neo-cons or not could be discussed here.  If the proceding sections are well written, they will be limited to things that can be easily verified, and all the debate about if Freedom House is good or bad will be contained in this section.     Calling this section """"Criticisms"""" has implications that I don't think are necessarly correct.

Basically, Ichabod is Jack Sparrow, Katrina is Elizabeth Swann, the Western Woods Crone is Tia Dalma, the Horseman is Davy Jones and Lady Van Tassel is Cutler Beckett while the Horseman's head plays the same role as Beckett's heart. Also Hot Fuzz, like Sleepy Hollow, features an intelligent law enforcer from a large city being dispatched to a rural area where a series of beheadings subsequently take place.

I am not very experienced in Wikipedia, but I feel this recent incident with the park ranger is a significant event, as important as him shouting baby killer at someone. The reason I believe this is that I have been the unpaid Park Ranger working the barrier and taking the abuse of the general public during prior shutdowns. Now, most of these people are frustrated and confused. They don't understand that it is not a decision the ranger at the barrier made, which is keeping them from entering, but a decision made by the leaders of the nation. When one of the leaders of the nation who caused the incident berates a person making barely above minimum wage, basically at one of the lowest levels of authority over that opening or closing decision, OVER AN INCIDENT HE HIMSELF CREATED that is an unprecedented level of hypocrisy and posturing for the cameras. He thought he'd look like a defender of the veterans, and fool people who couldn't reason well enough to realize he caused the very situation. He told that woman that SHE should be ashamed for doing her job as he and his fellow politicians directed. How dare he tell her to be ashamed for his actions?

Hi 

i) Let me express my strong reservations with promoting Kinfra through wikipedia, because it is a business entity.  Also, website of an organization is transient in nature. It can be updated and may change tomorrow.  So, as far as possible, we should use only published reports that cannot change with time.

ii) Still, what user  suggests could be accepted as a consensus, for now.

iii) This link to Public Relations Department does not have any word about Thiruvananthapuram being a hub now.  It speaks about cinema related activity in Thiruvananthapuram in 1970s/1980s. This cannot be used to claim Thiruvananthapuram's relevance today. But it could be a citation for the statement on Thiruvanthapuram being a base of Malayalam cinema in the past.

iv) Corporation of Thiruvanthapuram is a regional body and is not an unbiased source. This website of Corporation of Cochin (Kochi) also has such claims about cinema.   Claims of these bodies about pan-Kerala matters, like Cinema industry, cannot be used a a reliable source. These are outside the limits of their powers.

"Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.

I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.

In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.

 Withdrawn charges 

The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.

What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.

To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in """"enforcing"""" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your """"administrative"""" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse.

Removed from """"THEOLOGY"""" portion as it does not fit the title. Please discuss whether this fits under critism or political headings.

In many respects, the Jewish Messiah becomes nothing but a catalyst, even a figurehead, for Paulinism's own agenda. Paul's new religion had the advantage over other salvation-cults of being attached to the Hebrew Scriptures, which Paul reinterpreted as forecasting the salvific death of Jesus. This gave Pauline Christianity an awesome authority within the period culture that proved attractive to Gentiles thirsting for salvation. MacCoby, Hyam, The Mythmaker, Paul and the Invention of Christianity (ISBN 0-06-0155825)

A.N. Wilson, among others, contends  that Paul invented the Eucharist A.N Wilson, Paul:The Mind of the Apostle. (The contention that the eucharist originates in the religion of Mithras has been widely canvassed since at least the 2nd century when Justin Martyr disputed the allegation .)

He argues, likewise,  (ibid.)  that the idea of justification by faith was his and which can be contrasted with passages in the gospel and elsewhere where doing the will of God is paramount. 'Not everyone who says to me """"Lord, Lord"""", will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.' - Matthew 7:21)cf. James 2:18ff  

Those who characterize the tenets of Catholic Christianity as """"Pauline"""" compare it with its alternatives, beliefs that Christian theologians called heresies.

It is argued that the Paulines were responsible for the marginalisation of James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, in favour of Peter. The small scattered Jewish Jerusalem Church was disbanded in 135 with the banishment of the Jews from the region by the Romans, having been decimated during the Jewish revolt of 66-70AD.

Why should her name be kept secret? People should know who that girl was. Revealing her name will be true respect to her. This was the same thing her father said too and you think that by hiding her name you are respecting her. No you are doing the total opposite.Not only that her name is completely verifable. Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion but still revealing her name will inspire people. People made a publicity of her death and you say I'm the one disrespecting her.

 Anti-TKD slant 

I noticed that the article was changed to reflect a pro-foreign-influence slant.  I will eventually attempt to make appropriate edits in increments... edits made.  Comments welcome:  1. Introduction stated that TKD is an amalgamation of Chinese, Japan and Korean art.  While this may be factually true, it's a misleading introduction to TKD as many martial arts, including all forms of Karate, are amalgamations.  It serves no good purpose, other than NPOV agenda, to highlight this as an introduction to TKD.  2. Under """"development of TKD"""", controversies surrounding Karate's influence on TKD was overstated once again.  This topic is dealt with quite accurately in the Karate article.  It makes sense to follow that lead in this case.  It's misleading and NPOV the way it is written now.  3. Under """"traditional roots"""" TKD's foreign influence is again overstated.  Whoever, made these edits obviously had a pro-karate agenda.  The topic of foreign influence can be delt with in a fair and objective manner without being beaten to death under every subsection!  4. Under """"External Influence"""" foreign influence should be appropriately dealt with. 

The article is now overstating Taekwondo's relationship with Subak/Taekkyon; do we really need several long paragraphs all about """"Subak"""" (手搏) (whatever that was) and the Hwarang (whoever they really were) and Taekkyon supposedly slowly developing into Taekwondo over hundreds of years?  Taekkyon still exists today, so we can talk about Taekkyon's development in that article separately (noting that Taekkyon looks completely different from modern Taekwondo).  Japan's influences on Taekwondo are also well-documented, so why remove it?  Let's keep a neutral point of view for this article.  At this point, it sounds like the first few pages of a Taekwondo student's guide.

I think this needs to be looked into more carefully but history of Korean martial arts is a very relevant part of tkd.  Let's leave the text as is until we can sort this out.  I also have to say that your dismissive attitude isn't very POV.  Instead of blindly defending or rejecting labels, we need to deconstruct ideas and arguments and go through them with a fine comb.  Regardless of what you want to call it, Koreans have been kicking in fights and contests for thousands of years and documentation for this exists as far back as the three kingdoms era.  Chosun documentation also exists that show that Subak was part of the formal requirements for entrance into Chosun military and large Taekyon tournaments held by the populace well into the 1800's.  Most of Korean folk arts and traditional Korean disciplines existed and even thrived during the Chosun dynasty without formalization or systemization(e.g. korean wrestling called ssirum, pan sori, musical instruments, minstrels, etc.).  But the absence of formal schools, teachers and formal links doesn't mean that those arts weren't passed down or that they didn't exist.    While tkd isn't taekyon, tkd is a product of Korean attempts at formalizing a Korean martial art.  In an objective inquiry into TKD's origins, you need to understand the history and culture of Korean martial arts, culture and history.  To leave this out would be erroneously simplistic.  The martial arts aspect of Korean culture(folk culture during Chosun times) provides the basis for the formalization and systemization that Korean martial arts goes through in the 1900's.  TKD claims this, history and culture of Korean arts and disciplines provides the background for this, and the actual practice of tkd bears this out.  To ignore all this and look only for and only accept formal links between masters, students, formal schools, etc., is NPOV and more importantly wouldn't reflective objective reality behind TKD's conception.

btw.  There's a lot of crap out there about a lot of Korean martial arts but Hwarang are mentioned in Korean historical documents, Subak is mentioned countless times in military, historical records including Chosun records.  Taekyon was a part of Subak and its popularity was well documented by during Chosun times in its mention of Taekyon tournaments that were held well into the 1800's.   

To keep this (relatively) short, just a few points:

1. We know that """"Subak"""" has been mentioned in the Mooyedobotongji and other sources, but we don't really know exactly what """"Subak"""" actually referred to.  In China, the same word (pronounced """"Shoubo"""") was used as a general term for barehand martial arts, however - thus, it is likely that Koreans used the same word in the same way (as it was a loanword).
2. Hwarang are of course mentioned in many Korean texts, but we don't actually know",0,0,0

 HE BELIEVES IN OPENNESS BUT CLOSES HIS PAGE - BULL$HIT WE ALL SEE THRU U JIMBO 

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0,1,1

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   """,0,0,0

"Unfortunately some users are confusing two different issues:
A: name of Kurds and its roots.
B: origins of Kurds (i.e. who were Kurds forefathers.)
its is not completely clear what is origin of the name of Kurd. there are scholars who agree that it has a Sumerian root, used :A: either as a topynom for Kurdish regions or as a name for Hurrians. Some scholars who probably never heard about Sumerians think that it may origin from Corduchi, some others who are too biased say it is an Arabic word, though in Arabic language there is no root for a verb as KRD, for example in Arabic KTB exists and we can derive hundreds of words from this word, yaktubu, katib, maktub etc... but it is not possible with KRD;  this means that the word has a non-Arabic root and therefore it has a pre-Islamic origin.  before Arab invasion few Kurds were adientified as Kurds; but mostly either as Mede, or after name of their tribes.

Instrumental rudeness and pragmatic competence
Sometimes, people deliberately employ rude behaviors to achieve a goal.  Early works in linguistic pragmatism interpreted rudeness as a defective mode of communication.  However, most rudeness serves functional or instrumental purposes in communication, and skillfully choosing when and how to be rude may indicate a person's pragmatic competence.  

Prior to the mid-1990s, most linguistics research ignored the instrumental or 'useful' nature of rudeness in speech (Brown & Levinson, 1987; Grice, 1975; Lakoff, 1973).  Before then, rudeness was seen as a sign of communication failure:  Lakoff gave """"two rules"""" of pragmatic competence (1973): be clear, and be polite. Grice (1975) believed that rudeness violated universal norms of conversation of truthfulness, politeness and relevancy.  Likewise,  Brown and Levinson's politeness framework (1987  pp. 60-61) is also based on the idea that politeness is normative and rudeness is eschewed even when engaging in 'face-threatening acts' (FTAs) such as making a complaints or refusing a request.  """"The semantics and pragmatics of utterances must be taken into account in assessing degree of face redress; if the overt content of an utterance is rude, for example, politeness strategies won’t necessarily redeem it."""" (Brown & Levinson, 1987, p. 22)

Robin Lakoff (1989) addressed what she named 'strategic rudeness,' a style of communication used by prosecutors and therapists to force their interlocutors (a courtroom defendant or patient) to talk or react in a certain way.  

Gabriele Kasper (1990) gives us the earliest definition of rudeness in an academic paper.   In her discussion of Lakoff's (1989) research on strategic rudeness, Kasper (1990) defines rudeness as speech that is """"constituted by deviation from whatever counts as politic in a given social context, is inherently confrontational and disruptive to social equilibrium"""" (Kasper, 1990, p. 208).  This definition is important, in that it marks rudeness as speech which is confrontational at its core.  Although Kasper (1990) further defines rudeness as 'motivated' and 'unmotivated,' her definitions do not make use of natural data.  

It is not until Leslie Beebe's research comes along in the early to mid-1990s that data on naturally occurring instances of rudeness in everyday conversation is collected.  Drawing from Lakoff's (1989) idea of strategic rudeness, Beebe (1993a, 1993b, 1994, 1995) similarly proposes the concept of instrumental rudeness; rudeness that is meant to achieve a goal.  Like Lakoff (1989) and Kasper (1990), Beebe (1995) believes that rudeness is confrontational behaviour, and indeed in her research, she found that """"hostility seemed to pervade the data"""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 156).   In her study of naturally occurring rudeness in New York City, Beebe (1995) provides her own definition of rudeness:

""""In this study, rudeness is defined as a face threatening act (FTA)- or feature of an FTA such as intonation- which violates a socially sanctioned norm of interaction for the social context in which it occurs.  It is only rudeness if it receives insufficient redressive action to mitigate its force or, of course, if it does not occur in a context, such as intimacy or emergency, that would negate the need for redressive action.  Consequently, it causes antagonism, discomfort, or conflict and results in some disruption to the social harmony.   The idea that socially sanctioned norms of interaction are violated is central to the perception of rudeness."""" (Beebe, 1995, p. 159)

In this definition, Beebe (1995) asserts that rudeness is an FTA, or a feature of an FTA, that has not been mitigated by redressive action and does not occur between intimates or in emergency situations.  Essentially, rudeness is a bald, on-record face attack, and not a failed attempt at politeness.  This definition would also most likely preclude culturally-specific ritual insults, verbal games, or manners of speech that are used among members of certain social groups.   Labov (1972) argues that ritual insults, or 'sounding,' follow certain linguistic, organizational, and interactional rules.   If such speech among members of a cultural in-group could be seen as following 'socially sanctioned norms of interaction' (as Labov, 1972, argues) where there is a low risk of face-loss, it would most likely not be considered 'rude speech,' according to Beebe's (1995) definition of rudeness.

 Symbolism of resignation date 

It should be noted that Joseph Ratzinger, ex-conscript in (Adolf) Hitler Youth, announced its resignation as Pope Benedict XVI on february 11th 2013, Benedict of Aniane and Adolf of Osnabrück feast dayCaholic online. February fest days http://www.catholic.org/saints/f_day/feb.php. Maybe, this shoud be added in hid biography.   
WP:SYNTH   
Close, but there's no conclusion. Not combining sources, just listing two. Just out of curiousity, NummerSechs, why should this be noted? Is there anything beyond it just being a sort of weird coincidence?  (talk) 02:22, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Please READ WP:SYNTH which says: Do not combine material from multiple sources to reach or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources. If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C that is not mentioned by either of the sources. Emphasis is mine.   
I get that. But what's the implication? He announced his resignation on February 11, and February 11 was the feast day of saints with loosely-related names, therefore...?  (talk) 06:59, April 4, 2013 (UTC)
Since, I do not agree at all with InedibleHulk & Elizium23's comments, I put also this discussion on their talk page. Everything a Pope does, speaks, writes, acts, etc. is think well in advance on a very symbolic basis. Denying that, without arguments better than a lawyer point of view, means a complete ignorance about the essence of Pope's role in catholic world & over other Christian churches. BTW, I'm French, not Anglo-saxon, learned german at school, (J. Ratzinger is German) and I do believe that I have quite an authority to write that, since France is recognized Rome's first daughter.   
we can just say that it happens to be the same day as those feasts and let the readers draw their own conclusions. otherwise it is WP:synth. I do know German quite well, I have taken 3 years of German classes, one year has been college-level.  Aunva6talk - contribs  
It should be noted that February the 11th, Catholic Church also celebrates Notre Dame de Lourdes a.k.a Our Lady of Lourdes (south-west of France).

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

"Howie Payne 

 Hi  Keith D

I would like to protest the changes made by user 92.8.22.187 and subsequent locking of the page by yourself thus protecting his recent subbmissions
I have reverted the changes revisions made by this user several times due to lack of references and dubious POV  submissions.
The user was contacted and referred via previous talk message pages to point out & explain this but despite this continued to revise the page without providing references for the changes submitted. 
As you have now locked the page with these incorrect/unreferenced submissions in place I would implore you to re evaluate the submissions made by user 92.8.22.187 and act accordingly.

I will go into detail here in the hope it may help resolve some the issues with the edits submitted by  user 92.8.22.187:

 I see no reason to now have 4 references to support the spelling of a name that has not been contested. - One of which is a pay site and another that contains a personal address!
User 92.8.22.187 claims I have been changing the spelling of the name here despite his/her addition of references. A quick look will show I have been removing the references for matters outlined above but have not in any way changed the spelling of the name here. 
 The reference to Payne's involvement in The Stands (5) has been changed from a full length interview with Payne about The Stands in a national publication  (Designer Magazine) to review of a solo concert written 3 years after Payne's discontinuation of the group for a local fanzine that briefly introduces Payne as a former member of The Stands before reviewing a solo performance. 
 Payne emigrating to US at age 13 - no reference 
 Edgar Jones's commitment to Paul Weller being the reason for the break up of The Big Kids - No reference - Also Jones was no longer playing with Paul Weller at the time of The Big Kids break up (Winter 2001)  
 The information regarding Pilgrim and Thomson's departure and the subsequent demise of the group as a result of this is wholly misleading - Pilgrim left The Stands in December - 2004 and was replaced by Graham Robinson in January 2005. The Stands then releaesed the single Do It Like You Like  which entered the UK to 40 at no 26 and was used on the worldwide Revelon London Look  campagihn featuring Kate Moss. The Stands then toured with Oasis during both their Europian tour. Luke Thompson left The Stands in June 2005 http://www.gigwise.com/news/6615/Luke-Thomson-Leaves-The-Stands and was replaced by Paul Molloy. 
The Stands released Horse Fabulous in July 2005 played Glastonbury - V Festival - T in the Park - an Oasis UK stadium tour - and a headline tour before Howie Payne released a statement to say he was discontinuing The Stands in Nov 2005. All of this plus the fact that the bands label, Echo records was dissolved by Chrysalis during August 2005 is available on The Stands dedicated wiki page. To sum this up as user 92.8.22.187 has done is totally miss-leading and not based in fact.
Regarding Payne's solo career the new piece mentions Payne spending time in Texas and Los Angeles with neither relevance or reference. 
There is a further edit regarding Payne's name spelling and the submission implies there is a miss-spelling or changed spelling. As the only documents that are can decicivly prove the spelling of a persons birth name are Birth Certificate and Passport and none are provided here I will reserve judgement on this but I do think describing the spelling of Elliot (as here) as standard is ridiculous. There are at least popular spellings of the ame Elliott/Elliot/Eliot/Eliott/Elyott and it would seem the most popular is Elliott.
I do not wish to appear to be pedantic regarding this but as this is typical of the caviler way user 92.8.22.187 has applied vague guesswork and then claimed them facts to the page in question and has accused me of changing his/her referenced submissions which is clearly not the case
 
I hope that as a long standing contributor to wikipeidia you can see that my aim is to prevent this page being a false interpretations of events littered with unnecessary unreferenced/POV information.

The previous page edition 01:30, 25 November 2012 has correct referenced information and I believe is a suitable and proper representation of events as per the information available at this point.

Re the definition of what is obsolete, that is simple. Every concept is built based on some data. When new data have been obtained, the concept must either accommodate these data or explain why these data can be ignored. The concept that fail to do so is deemed obsolete. For instance, the early theory of the Universe claimed that the Universe is stationary. However, after discovery of the red shift by Hubble it became obvious that this theory is inconsistent with these data. Now this theory is believed to be obsolete.

 Point by point 

(1) The current text has:
Take, for example, the rainbow of colours reflected from a puddle of water when a thin film of oil rests on its surface. That phenomenon can be understood by thinking of light as waves, the length of which results in different colours.A very clear explanation of interference in thin films may be found in Sears, op. cit., p. 203ff. Other phenomena, like the working of light meters in cameras, can be explained by thinking in terms of particles of light (called photons) colliding with the detection screen inside the meter, the force of which is registered mechanically by a pointer or needle.

This is just plain wrong.  The length of waves does not """"result in different colours."""" The different wavelengths of light are perceived as different colors.  And the fact that the waves of light have different lengths does not explain the """"rainbow of colours"""" either. If the editor had bothered to read Sears he would have an understanding that would allow a correct explanation, not an exercise in the mystification of the novice reader.  

Second, the description of the light meter suggests a device like the carnival strength meter in which a contestant strikes a lever using a sledge hammer and the other end of the lever hits a ball that then moves vertically alongside a measuring stick of some kind. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Even if the crude analogy of an electron as a bullet that strikes electrons and knocks them out of their original planetary orbits be accepted, the electrons do not then physically strike the end of a needle that then moves along a dial face. T

If this article is to be radically rewritten, it should be done so with both a clear understanding of what the true facts are and also with an eye to presenting those facts in a way that will not cause very damaging preconceptions to form in the mind of the novice reader.

It is the differences in phases between the light waves reflected by the air/oil surface vs. the phases in the light waves reflected by the oil/water interface that effectively """"cancels"""" light of some wavelengths and permits light of some wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer from each different region of thickness of the oil film.  You criticized the original diagram that clearly shows how interference occurs as """"off-putting."""" But what have you put in its place?

It is the (mechanical analogy) pressure of the dislodged electrons that moves them off of the surface of the metal plate and through a wire to an electromagnet that attracts the spring-balanced needle which then moves in a way proportional to the induced amperage. Then they go through another wire back to the """"low pressure"""" region of the metal plate. Even in modern light meters, it is all a matter of electrons moving in electrical circuits, not electrons pushing on lever arms.

Please be careful to give the most useful citations. I have discovered one citation that is a circular reference to a Wikipedia article by way of an external """"encyclopedia."""" Also, the expression """"Trojan wave packet"""" will not mean anything to the average well informed reader, hence serving only to create an air of mystery and incomprehensibility.  I have already supplied a reference that distinguishes Trojan wave packets from other wave packets.  """,0,0,0

 Truthfulness, higher and lower are not well definable - they are simply relativistic and work at any point on the spectrum. For example you could say """"relative to humans, bovines are lower organisms,"""" but you could also say """"algae are lower organisms relative to mammals such as bovines and humans."""" You could use """"complex and simple"""" in the same way, but to me there appears to be some kind of teleological argument embedded in them. """"Higher and lower"""" are not too much different from """"complex and simple"""" in that they do not come from any """"theory"""" except to say that when a person looks at a chimp, they realize that the chimp is missing a few things that the human being has. That's just a fact, and remains such regardless of any well-crafted teleological counterarguments. ::::: Perhaps what you are really arguing is that """"higher and lower"""" are somewhat 
qualitative terms, and that science should not make qualitative distinctions, only quantitative ones. This is a valid argument, but only if science POV does not trump NPOV.

Comment by Mattchewbaca – I would just like to commend you THR, for putting forth the time and effort to put this problem into perspective. Hopefully, with the great investigative work you have demonstrated here, this will send a message to these editors that their GA reviewing buddy circle is not to be taken seriously. Beyond the reciprocity of this group and their articles is the depreciated level of their reviewing knowledge. Some in this group, with or without realizing it, are responsible for the current diminished state of GA class articles. While I can't speak for each and every one of these editors, I have had personal experience with a few of them, two of which are , and .

The article Halfway Gone, which was nominated by  and reviewed by , in September 2010, was selected by myself to undergo WP:GAR. As you can see, the article clearly does not meet the WP:GA requirements. Many of the refs are duplicates of one another, including: Refs 19 and 35, 20 and 37, 21 and 33, 22 and 34, 23 and 40. There is the use of both Nielsen Business Media and Prometheus Global Media for the Billboard references. There are refs that do not support actual claims. Two-thirds of the Live performances section is factually inaccurate, seeing as though they are not live performances but instead taped and aired later that evening. My attempt at a successful de-listing of the article was met with resistance and consequently it still remains as a GA.

 reviewed Howling Bells (album), an article which I nominated for GA. He quick-failed the article within 57 minutes of creating the review page. His review baffled me, it seemed as though he did not have the knowledge required to actually be reviewing an article because the majority of his claims, as far as faults in the article went, were unfounded, they simply were not true. The other points in the article he claimed as weaknesses easily could have fixed within ten minutes.

Fighting Temptation is another article that  quick-failed the day after my GA nominated article was failed by him. He proceeded to pass this article after he and the nominator came to an agreement to where he would allot a certain amount of time to the nominator to make corrections based on his GA review. David Lucas (composer) is another GA nominated article that he has had quick-failed just this week. After the nominator of that article reached out to him on his talk page stating that she could have fixed all of the issues addressed in a timely manner, he agreed to give put the nomination on hold and allow her time to make the changes. Within 48 minutes of leaving the message on his talk page, the nominator had made all the changes to the article brought up by him, and now he has passed the article that he initially quick-failed. In the past,  was warned here to stop reviewing articles and had a thread started about him and his bad GA reviewing.

In closing, I would like to say that getting any of the articles that I work on to GA status no longer is a concern to me. These editors have flooded the market with their paltry articles and now GA is not a true representation. I find it amusing that these editors still nominate their articles for GA as if it's a noteworthy achievement... it makes me ponder. They seem to not realize that their GA articles are in the same league with a C-class article masquerading as a GA. Even though my comments were a bit off topic, I would again like to express gratitude to you THR, for casting light upon this matter which needs to be properly addressed at an administrative level. This act of back scratching amongst these editors as well as their abominable reviewing standards has to cease if GA status is to exemplify what it truly stands for.  (meow) """,0,0,0

"She is not an undocumented worked, as she is not working.  It is unfair to punish me with my attempt to include a key fact (I have modified it is several different ways in an attempt to compromise, but to also make sure this critically important fact is included in the article).

I have fairly and accurately stated that she should be listed as an illegal immigrant/alien in the history as you initially asked. (others, you twice and Ramsey2006 has done three reverts.  Not only to undo my additions, but the person with address 68.whatever)

The fact that biased sources (i.e. people with links to groups involved in the story with an agenda can revert a known fact for political reason completely undermines wikipedia.)  Know, this is the first article I have attempted to edit, but this omission is considerable. 

Now, I am learning as I go, I put clear reasons in the history for my change, at your request, but you have punished me a second time, by reverting back.

Reasoning:

Somebody who crosses the border illegally is an illegal alien.

Elvira Arellano is therefore an illegal alien.

Elvira Arellano may also be an undocumented worker, but so a teenager who does not report baby sitting wages.

To list Elvira Arellano as solely and undocumented worker, with no reference to her being an illegal immigrant/alien is factually negligent.

Countless news articles refer to her as such:

"""POV fix ==

I removed text that claimed that most liberals claim the posting of the commandments on a government building violated the """"separation of church and state"""" (and the statement that """"separation of church and state is not part of the constitution"""" or whatever it was) and replaced it with """"liberals oppose the posting of the Ten Commandments on public property, arguing that it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."""" and I wikified the link to the first amendment.

While posting the ten commandments is not literally """"making a law"""" establishing a state religion, it could create a """"slippery slope"""" situation that eventually entangles government in religion to a degree that the establishment clause is more likely to be violated.  It is a rational position to presume that it is safer for the constitution for the government to """"avoid the appearence"""" of impropriety by not posting religious symbols.  I wonder how many Christian or Jewish groups would like to walk past a Ganesh or Buddha statue whenever they go to court?  Probably they wouldn't.  Religious neutrality is a critical element of American civil society, and reflects the reality of pluralistic religious faith.  By acknowledging none, the government is actually honoring all of them and the beliefs of every American as equal.  

It would also violate the Equal Protection clause for the religious beliefs of any citizen, including a belief that the ten commandments were of divine origin, or that the clearly religious commandments must be upheld to avoid angering a god, to be sponsored by the government by posting them as they commonly are on government buildings.

These positions better reflect the normative liberal view of the establishment clause, and I will see if it is possible to work them into the article as a description of these philosophies, without promoting them.  Understanding positions that are contrary to your own can be an important source of personal intellectual growth.

I also explained the conservative/religious view of the posting a bit better, and deleted the reference to the Dershowitz article because 1) it was totally irrelevant (about same sex marriage, not posting the ten commandments), and 2)the editor who referenced it to support his POV argument that liberals only favor a separation of church and state when it suits their purposes either deliberately or accidently misunderstood Dershowitz's point.  Dershowitz was arguing that government should be less entangled in deciding who could get married than it is now, and leave it to the individual religious to decide what marriages are acceptable.  This would promote the separation of church and state, not undermine it.  Because it was both POV, and reflected confused thinking, not to mention totally irrelevant, I simply removed it rather than trying to fix it.

MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking the romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

Catholic League ^ | August 18, 2006 | Bill Donohue Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, offered the following comments today on the popularity of Catholic-bashing plays: “The Helen Hayes Theatre in New York must be experiencing hard times these days, otherwise it wouldn’t be home to ‘Kiki & Herb: Alive on Broadway.’ According to Variety, the play claims that the Catholic Church is run by the Nazis and that ‘the devil really does wear Prada’; the devil is the pope. To show how timely they are, the play’s producers manage to squeeze in a smack at Mel Gibson, dropping the line ‘now he wants the Jews to treat him...

Can't agree with that approach at all. What we need is clear, transparent, consistent rules for inclusion that will be applied to all articles irrespective of whether they are massacres allegedly perpetrated by the West or anyone else. The 'case by case' approach is a recipe for WP:BIAS and contrary to achieving WP:NPOV given the numerical preponderance of British and American editors and their inevitably skewed perspective. (And while I'm here may as well mention that I disagree with your comments on the British Isles issue; """"New England"""" is no analogy!)

1. """"Any Wikipedian worth his salt"""" will look at a source before dismissing it. You - by your own admission - called it """"nonsense"""" without bothering to check where and when and by whom it was published (and it all says on the front page had you bothered to Google it, plus it was referenced). I call that sloppy at the very least.
2. We have a policy for dealing with contradicting reliable sources - it's called WP:DUE. It says that """"viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources"""" are to be given space in the article """"in proportion to the prominence"""" of their viewpoints. So even if we knew the figures in any source about Bleiburg were off (which we can't possibly know anyway) we are not supposed to automatically reject the source in question if it represents a significant viewpoint (in this particular case the differing histories told by historians all over the region do represent """"significant viewpoints""""). In fact, we are actually supposed to include it and we are actually obliged to do so per WP policy.  (''talk) """,0,0,0

In reply to  you state in your edit summary for the """"Existence of God"""" article: """"Undid revision 256247715 by 74.4.222.208 (talk) Difference is of opinion is not vandalism. Omega point is fringe."""" That claim doesn't even make coherent sense, besides the fact that you replaced a literate entry with an illiterate edit.

Even if one incorrectly thinks that the Omega Point Theory is """"fringe,"""" that has no logical connection with the edit that Jeffro77 made. Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

You do realize that a vast body of literature and academic works refers to the places in Ukraine solely by their Russian names, especially in historical contexts?

He linked my 710 contributions [166] and entirely falsely wrote 'Not so ridiculous when you look at his contributions which seem to be all geared around the May elections. This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith. Examples: List of European Union member states by GDP growth and Mr Galloway Goes to Washington. I have successfully nominated dozens of articles for speedy deletion. As a new editor, I am deeply upset by how hard it is to edit this site without abuse and being treated like a moron (WP:BITE). It certainly is not encouraging for those wanting to make a difference in good faith.
Nothing at WP:SPA points to me. 5.The editor has breached multiple policies.

Editor still going. He has written now 'What makes you think I give a fuck about your political leanings?' (despite questioning them) and removed the ANI notification remarking 'what a waste of time'. What is the point of WP:CIVIL, WP:AGF, WP:NPA, WP:BITE?

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth. How can they possibly say that with your agreement? 
I will address each other point at the ANI if you wish.   """,0,0,0

"Ah, look, another sock-buddy of TheOldJacobtrite crawls out the woodwork to support his opinionated and personal-editing prejudice. And still they hypocritically defy admin.
Mark Arsten was the Admin who made the decision when TheOldJacobite tried to refer me for vandalism... Electric Wombat made his own views known.
Yes, the BBC appear to have archived off their radio interview and feature broadcast since the original edit. It looks like they do this after 14 days. However, the newspaper articles are still online, as is the download pages that prove that this was a properly released single with a full marketing and promotional plan behind it...(I suppose that you'll next be saying that Amazon and Apple are not credible reference points to confirm the song!!!). The charity's official website also contains a suitable reference that conforms to Wiki policy.  Their website is registered with the UK Government's Charity Commission as their official registered website, or are you intending to argue that the Charities Commission of the United Kingdom also fails to meet credibility policy?  (it would not surprise me if you did, even though that organization also has it's own Wiki entry and is referenced thousands of times in other articles - editors like you and TheOldjacobite like to pick and choose which reference points based on personal opinion, and not the fact of the matter.  That is shown in your logs. Having looked at WP:SONGCOVER for the twentieth time, this entry clearly meets all the criteria, so please stop quoting policy enforcement when the policy is met, otherwise you risk making yourself look more and more stupid every time you delete it or incorrectly quote a policy to which the entry conforms.
TheOldJacobite and his other sock-puppets, or buddy puppets, have referred the entry to admin, for both an (unfounded) allegation of vandalism, and whether the entry met policy criteria. He also asked for the page to be locked, and me blocked, on the basis of the entry - see the referrals for vandalism and page locking request pages...etc.  The entry was reviewed and found to be suitable and referenced correctly, even if the BBC programme has since been archived - that is, however, the whole point of the archival retrieval date noted within the reference tag.
The Admin do not feel that the page warrants locking, nor me to be blocked, as I am simply conforming to Wikipedia policies; policies that are so liberally quoted at me by those who then hypocritically contradict the very policy they like to crow about.
Is it any wonder that thousands of people are wholly unsatisfied with the general atmosphere within Wikipedia when a few (almost trolling) editors like to arbitrarily remove information simply based on personal views rather than verifiable links. TheOldJacobite, Sjo and now you, have simply shown that if you are proven wrong, had the policies correctly pointed out to you (later backed up by admin) you STILL will not accept the edit, preferring instead to continue playing childish games in repetitive removal of something to which you have some sort of weird personal issue with.
Your own deletion of this edit, following admin's clear acceptance of the entry is - like TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's behavior - now clearly in breach of Wiki policy and now suitable for requesting a temporary edit block to be placed on your account for, basically, ignoring admin's earlier decision on this matter.",0,0,0

 TruSilver, Mediation, et al 

You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off

While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.

My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)

Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.

My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:

 TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.

 TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was """"willing to discuss"""" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.

 TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to """"edit warring"""" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.

I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.

While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h",0,0,0

"Our family was also really fond of Audi, and owned two. The second one, a red 5000, did however unintendedly accelerate when I was at an intersection, and almost caused me to get into a head-on collision as I was attempting a left hand turn. I was familiar with the news at the time regarding the unintended acceleration, and the fact that the pedals were close together, so I released my foot from what I thought were both pedals, looked down and placed my foot on the brake only, the engine kept racing, and due to my leg strength, I was able to control the 5000, but I can see how a weaker person caught unaware might not be able to control the car as the rpm's were past 5000. As it was, it still took about 10-20feet to control the Audi. If it didn't happen to me, I wouldn't have believed it. As it was happening I couldn't believe it.

 No association between """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""" and """"Bell Labs""""? 

Earlier on this page,  had enquired:

Name origin
Wasn't the parent company (and hence weren't the labs) named after Alexander Graham Bell?  No mention of him can I find here. Carrionluggage 

Today User:BilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled """"Early namesake"""" in its entirety, which chronicled the """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""", also known as the Volta Laboratory (which A.G. Bell created after he won the Volta Prize). The deleted section was titled 'Early namesake' for the reason that there was an association by name as follows:
 1876 –A.G. Bell receives master phone patent, becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed American Bell Telephone Company;
 1880 –A.G. Bell creates the Volta Laboratory, a.k.a. the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, for research into sound recording and transmission, including the photophone; also
 1880 –""""the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T; Long Lines."""" A.G. Bell still owns shares in ABTC, and hence thus is part owner of AT&T;  he remains """"Chief Electrician"""" of ABTC and its children for several years;
 1881 –Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric;
 1885  –The long lines project """"was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)"""";
 1899  –""""the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell""""  (that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child);
 1925 –Bell Labs is created, and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of AT&T;'s engineering department.

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or AT&T; Engineering, and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot, since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection. That there was a connection by name and share ownership, as shown above, is obvious; therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article.  Comments?

"Sinhalese Nagas 
It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha. Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island. Origins of the Hela Race. Hela was combination of Raksha, Yaksha, Deva, Naga. 

Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles,.. At the time of start writing the history, Raksha and Deva wasn't powerful. Naga was the most powerful authorities. That time only they had kingdoms. It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna. Others lived as small groups ( kuveni's story). 

Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya. After 2,3 generations from Pandukabhaya, kings tend to suffix 'Tissa' and 'Naga' to their names. Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe. There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe. This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms ( most probably Nagadeepa) made connections to the royal family in Rajarata. Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others. So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain Naga/Sinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule. But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata.  

It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king. Those days without having clear power king can't survive. Yaksha's had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya. But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families. Since conflicts between tribes hasn't been ended, Naga/Sinha king wasn't be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days. Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana. Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas. Ritigal Jayasena was one of them.

So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna. SL was unified on tribe basis. After SL was converted to buddhism it wasn't required to unify tribes which based on religion. Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism (due to fear for Asoka) Rajarata king could made his brother ( MahaNaga) as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance. So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas.",0,0,0

 NPOV and unbalanced 

I would prefer both tags, but I suppose once is enough.  First a certificate of Life birth is not a birth certificate which the lefties are trying to say as proof he was born in hawaii.  If his mom was a astronaunt and gave give on the moon, he could still have a certificate of live birth.  So the certificate of live birth is worthless as evidence.  His own family says he was born in Kenya, and if so his father was kenya and his mom was 16 and could not pass US citizenship to Obama.  If this claim is true, he cannot be a natural born citizen required by artical 2 section 1 of the us constitution.  Secondly his islamic school in Indonesia required him to be a Indonesian citizen, while it may be possible to get an exception, we don't know.  He has traveled to ?Iran? during the 1980s when it was illegal for Us citizens to travel there, was his travels illegal or did he travel under a different citizenship.  There is no proof that obama is a natural born citizen yet more than enough doubt, and there have been lawsuits over these doubts but the courts are refusing to hear these cases.  We cannot say Obama was born in Hawaii, nor can we say he was Born in Kenya, his birthplace is unknown.  Obama and his team of lawyers, probably on the taxpayers dole, are trying to hide whether or not he is a natural born citizen; smells fishy, what does he have to hide?  As long as we have a constitution, we have to find that out or he is not the president.  Needless to say our brave military have joined a quo warrento lawsuit, and ask by what authority obama has to be president and CEO over them.  It remains an open issue, and so far there is no evidence leading us to his birthplace or his citizenship status, however the bulk of the evidence points in the direction of him being illegal.

  also being censored are obamas ties to socialist and terrorist organizations.  He is affiliated with Ayers, who an uncover FBI agent recorded a dialog where Ayers group planned to kill 25 million americans who could not convert to socialism.

Wikipedia sued for ‘aiding neo-Nazis’
December 7, 2007 - 11:14AM

A left-wing German politician has filed charges against online encyclopaedia Wikipedia for promoting the use of banned Nazi symbols in Germany.

Katina Schubert, a deputy leader of the Left party, said she had filed the charge with Berlin police on the grounds that Wikipedia’s German language site contained too much Nazi symbolism, particularly an article on the Hitler Youth movement.

“The extent and frequency of the symbols on it goes beyond what is needed for documentation and political education, in my view,” she told Reuters. “This isn’t about restricting freedom of opinion, it’s about examining what the limits are.”

Schubert said she had taken legal advice before making her move, and that she hoped it would encourage public debate on how far internet platforms should be allowed to aid proponents of extremist, anti-semitic and racist ideologies.

“There are signs neo-Nazis are trying to take advantage of such structures, and this needs to be stopped in good time,” Schubert said. “Especially given that Wikipedia is too important to jeopardise as an open and self-regulating project.”

A spokesman for Wikimedia Deutschland, an organisation that promotes the internet lexicon in Germany, rejected the charge.

“We don’t really know what Ms Schubert’s problem is,” Arne Klempert, managing director of Wikimedia Deutschland, told Reuters. “What’s important is the context the symbols are used in, and here it’s quite clearly education and documentation.”

“Anyone who tries to prevent the Nazi period being documented properly has a strange understanding of the world, in my view,” Klempert said. “Because that’s the best weapon there is (to prevent) something like that from happening again.”

Public display of Nazi symbols is illegal in Germany, but they can be used for educational and artistic purposes.

Schubert also came under fire from party colleagues.

“Katina Schubert fails to grasp the self-regulating mechanisms that work in Wikipedia,” Heiko Hilker, a Left party media expert in Saxony’s state parliament, said in a statement.

“Right-wing extremism on the World Wide Web cannot be tackled via national criminal proceedings,” he added.

Schubert said police would pass on the charge to state prosecutors, who would decide whether to open an investigation.

Klempert said Wikipedia’s structure, which enables internet users to discuss and edit content, ensured no bias arose. “Particularly on subjects like the Hitler Youth, you can be sure it would be changed in seconds if it did (show bias),” he said.

The Hitler Youth was the Nazis’ official youth organisation.

The Jazz Bird: Fact vs. fiction 
________________________________________

        Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird, is based on the 1927 murder trial of Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus. Here's a quick look at where fact and fiction converge and diverge: 
        George Remus, the killer 
        Fiction: A lawyer and pharmacist who comes to Cincinnati from Chicago in the 1920s with a scheme that makes him at least $20 million. He buys distilleries licensed to sell “medicinal” whiskey to drug companies and then sells the booze to dummy drug companies while shipping it to illegal customers. 
        Truth: A lawyer and pharmacist, he was a friend and co-counsel of famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow testified as a character witness for him at his trial. He came to Cincinnati from Chicago and turned a $10,000 investment into an estimated $80 million fortune in less than three years. He sold “medicinal” whiskey to legitimate drug companies he set up, then stole the whiskey from the drug companies. 
        Charlie P. Taft, the prosecutor 
        Fiction: He is the son of former United States President William Howard Taft and plans a career in politics. He fades away after losing the case. 
        Truth: He was the youngest son of the former president. He became Hamilton County prosecutor just a few months before the trial. His political career suffered a setback after the trial — he wasn't nominated for a second term as prosecutor. He did stay in politics, helping found the Cincinnati Charter Committee and serving as a councilman and mayor until his retirement almost 50 years later. He ran an unsuccessful race as a Republican for Ohio governor in 1952, the year George Remus died. 
        Imogene Remus, the victim 
        Fiction: She is the wealthy 25-year-old daughter of a high society family in Cincinnati. She is the wife of a World War I veteran left in a coma by a shell fragment when she meets George Remus. She tries, unsuccessfully to get Remus accepted by Cincinnati society. 
        Truth: She was a 35-year-old secretary in Chicago when she divorced her first husband to marry George Remus, who divorced his first wife to marry her. She entertained lavishly in Cincinnati in hopes of being accepted into Cincinnati society. The Cincinnati upper crust was willing to buy Mr. Remus' whiskey, but never accepted him, or his wife, as social equals. She was 39 when she was killed. 
        The trial 
        Fiction: George Remus defends himself, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. He plays to the press and frequently disrupts the proceedings, which are likened to a Vaudeville show by the Enquirer. The jury acquits him in 20 minutes, recommends his release from the hospital in time for Christmas and drinks up at a party he throws for them. 
        Truth: That's all true.

Logan duked out for AP honor 
________________________________________

The Associated Press 
        ATLANTA — UC's Steve Logan was third behind Duke's Jason Williams and Kansas' Drew Gooden in voting for The Associated Press college basketball player of the year. 
        UC's Bob Huggins was fifth in voting for coach of the year. 
        Logan received eight votes, Williams 38 and Gooden 18 from the 72-member national panel that selects the weekly AP Top 25. 
        Huggins got 7 votes behind Pittsburgh's Ben Howland (16), Bob Knight of Texas Tech (11), Ernie Kent of Oregon (10) and Roy Williams of Kansas (9). 
        Williams, the only unanimous All-America selection this season, is the second straight Duke player to be selected national player of year and the fifth Blue Devil to win the Adolph Rupp Award. 
        Shane Battier won last season. The other Duke players to be honored were Elton Brand in 1999, Christian Laettner in 1992 and Art Heyman in 1963. 
        Williams thanked his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, who missed the ceremony after undergoing hip replacement surgery on Wednesday. 
        “Being with Coach K the past three years is the best thing I could have ever asked for,” Williams said. “I owe him everything.” 
        Williams, a junior also voted to the All-America team as a sophomore, averaged 21.3 points, 3.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists for the defending champion Blue Devils (31-4), ranked No. 1 for all but four weeks this season. He shot 45.7 percent from the field, including 38.3 percent from 3-point range.

 What I addad 

The below was liked. If someone wants to chop this down and add it, be my guest. ~   

In 2012, the Journal of Palestine Studies was forced to translate and publish a 1937 letter of David Ben-Gurion after the pressure group CAMERA reported an error made in a journal article written by Pappé. In his article, Pappé had written, """"Ben-Gurion, for example, wrote in a letter to his son in 1937, 'The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war, citing pages 167–68 of David Smith's 2004 Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict. After checking Smith's book for the quote, CAMERA noticed that there had been an error in citation, and wrote to JPS saying so: """"the quote attributed to Ben-Gurion does not appear in the citation provided."""" The JPS verified this, but in doing so highlighted something that CAMERA had not:

The JPS, for its part, does not mention that the paperback version of Pappé's book, certainly at least the 2011 reprint, uses (p. 23) the quote with the same mark positioning as the JPS article—""""The Arabs will have to go, but one needs an opportune moment for making it happen, such as a war."""" The paperback provides different sources to the Smith citation used in the journal article, though: """"Ben-Gurion's Diary, 12 July 1937, and in New Judea, August–September 1937, p. 220.""""

Having uncovered these citation errors and discrepancies, the journal decided to go the final step and have the entirety of Ben-Gurion's letter translated into English. The translated letter confirms that, regardless of citation errors, the underlying interpretation of the letter provided by Pappé's article and book was sound. In the letter to his son, Ben-Gurion is quite clear: """"We must expel Arabs and take their place.""""""",0,0,0

""""The violence was undoubtedly racial. Its prime targets were the Chinese merchants who have flocked to Tibet by road and on a prestigious new train across the roof of the world. 

The mobs were the losers of Lhasa – the poor who seethe with resentment, outwitted commercially by Chinese traders, out-gunned by the Chinese army and, many fear, ultimately to be outnumbered by Chinese migrants.""""

 Suggestions to impove the article 

There suggestions to improve the article. This is the comments from 

Lead

 Your writing has a lot of adverbs like """"originally"""" """"primarily"""" """"mainly"""", these aren't necessary.  Sometimes they have a place but they also clutter up the prose and many of them can be removed.
 Third cable channel behind disney and nick.  Third in what?  Kids' programming?  It's not clear.
 Overall in the lead the writing is choppy and needs to be streamlined.  Here's an example:
""""Since 2009, it began airing a small amount of live-action programming, specifically movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, both of which are also owned by Time Warner.""""  Rewrite like this, """"In 2009 it started airing live-action programming, including movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema.""""  No one cares that they're owned by Time Warner.
 See WP:LEAD for instructions on what should be in a good lead.  The lead should be a summary of the entire article and this lead should be enhanced to include every subject within the article (written in a summary style).

History

 The clean up banner is legitimate and should be addressed.  Usually clean up banners should be handled before the article is listed at WP:PR.  I can see a number of  templates in the following sections.  These should be addressed and the sourcing improved.
 As a general rule every paragraph should have at least one source, and more if there are multiple assertions.
 See WP:INCITE for reference anchor placement.  They don't go in the middle of the sentence but rather at the end unless the assertion is very controversial.
 The parenthetical reference in the first sentence is too detailed.  Give a few examples of what was acquired and leave it at that.
 Watch out for one sentence paragraphs.  These stubs are not acceptable at GAC.  Consider combining or expanding.
 Make sure titles are always italicized even when not linked.
 What is meant by the """"Powerhouse era""""?  What is powerhouse music?  

Programming

 This is a section with no prose.  Not good.  Sections with just a tophat are unnecessary.  Either add some prose or remove the section.  I think you fold in most of the programming info in the previous section.

Related projects

 Here is a section """"Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall"""" see above.

References

 The key to references is consistency.  Make sure every website ref has at least the title, url, publisher, and accessdate.
 You probably want to use templates like  to help with consistency.
 Deviantart appears to be a blog or discussion forum.  This is not a credible reference.  See WP:CITE and WP:VERIFY for instructions on credible references.  Avoid blogs, forums, chat rooms, social networking sites etc.

Overall

 As stated above the article needs a lot more referencing.  This will be a major sticking point if you want it to pass GAC.  * I would also seek out someone who can do a thorough copy edit.
 There isn't much about the financing of the channel, advertising revenue, demographics that sort of thing.  It would be nice to see some more information on these topics.
 This concludes my review.  Please contact me on my talk page if you have specific questions.  Best of luck to you.

I've fix the issue. Some movies were carried from 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures which are not owned by Time Warner. I've improved some  it a little bit, but the article needs to be rewrite and remove any blog, user and fan sites which are not reliable. Any reliable sources can be added per WP:V and WP:RS.

Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v. Sandoval, and noting that the text and structure of Title X do not create a private right of action to enforce Title X, the executive branch shall construe Title X not to create a private right of action.

When he says """"any microbes' would likely be dormant, cryopreserved by the current freezing conditions, and so metabolically inactive and unable to repair cellular degradation as it occurs."""" that is what everyone thought at the time the paper was written. Now the observation of a drop of salty water on the leg of Phoenix, and developments in theoretical understanding and studies of extremophiles able to live in very salty water lead to the idea of habitats where the salt deliquesces and the temperatures are high enough for the salty water to be liquid enough for long enough for life to reproduce, if it is there.

There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn't have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it's a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn't get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It's really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad's friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.

On Makemi’s previous comment
Makemi said """"I'm not clear on how this is revolutionary, it seems like a bigger/faster/louder computer piano.""""

I deleted the remark on the CEUS being a milestone. I even deleted anything that could be judged as being a praise. Despite the fact that even the praises I made were based on facts, on the quest that has been going on for more than two decades by makers of reproducing pianos to try to produce a reproducing piano that would truly record and playback the full gamut of expressiveness of the best performers at the piano.

So here is the current article that I have, incorporating the recent change I made, following Makemi’s feedback. Any praise of any kind has been deleted by me (even though my praises were based on facts, on knowledge).

The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano
Pianos That Has For goal of Accomplishing Full Expressiveness at the Keyboard==
During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that several pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.

The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.

Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.
At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.

Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular """"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos"""" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).

Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND PLAYBACK THE FULL GAMUT OF EXPRESSIVENE",0,0,0

The lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder - not an accidental, natural or judicially sanctioned death.

I do sympathise and understand that for Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself. For the self-esteem of the so-called republican movement, and for the political future of Sinn Féin, it is vital that its 30-year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war, a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim. The vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may, under pressure, be described as wrong. They may be accepted as """"mistakes"""". PIRA may acknowledge, in the curiously passive language it favours, that these things """"should not have happened"""". But they must never, ever, be called crimes. God forbid!

As I say, you can't read English closely and this generates numerous misprisions in your understanding both of sources and what others say.

I am completely indifferent to whatever geneticists say about history, unless they are practiced historians.
(a)does not allow you to infer, and repeatedly say, that the meaning is: Nishadani clearly stated that are not familiar with population genetics, nor they believe in that science.'
Where in that sentence do I state that I am unfamiliar with population genetics, and disbelieve that discipline? I am saying nothing about genetics: I am stating my scepticism about geneticists stepping outside their discipline to make arguments about another discipline, namely historiography. Peer-reviewed geneticists have RS credibility as geneticists, not historians, as peer-reviewed historians have RS competence as historians, not geneticists. Sometimes you have dual competence, as with C.D. Darlington, or Jits van Straten, but the geneticists you cite, if you check the historical books in their bibliographies, use dated or unreliable sources for their history, and make frequent errors, as many reviews have shown.
(b)'You protest my writing:'What geneticists define as 'Jewishness' in Europe relates to male founder genes' and call me a racist who insults Jews.
Here you fail to understand what geneticists define as 'Jewishness'. I am not using that language, the view is not therefore mine. If you have a problem with this take it up with Harry Ostrer, whose work you keep citing, or with experienced science reporters who report him saying that markers on the DNA reveal """"a biological basis for Jewishness,""""..
Reflect on this. You keep screwing up the obvious meaning of sentences. It's a reportable offence to do this when one of the consequences of your failure to understand my English is that you imdulge in wildly false accusations that a reasonable editor, making reasonable remarks, is an antisemite.

 Severed vs. cut in two 

Editor  made the change from """"severed"""" to """"cut in two"""".  """"Cut in two"""" is actually more accurate, and his explanation was also correct.  """"Severed"""" *isn't* quite correct.  I realize that there was a book on Short published under the title, """"Severed"""" (it's in my library, in fact).  But, if you look closely at the definition of """"sever"""", Short's body wasn't really severed, it was cut in two.  Definition of """"sever"""" from Webster's: to put or keep apart  divide; especially  to remove (as a part) by or as if by cutting.  To put or keep apart is accurate when referring to people who have severed relationships.  Divide; especially  to remove (as a part)... doesn't fit what happened to Short's body, because her body wasn't divided into parts but actually bisected.  With all of this in mind, I think that if """"severed"""" is insisted on and kept, the words, """"in two"""" need to be added.

It is true (this is also said above) that the majority of links which went to The Nation (disambiguation) were meant to go to The Nation (U.S. periodical).  However, I found that in all the cases where this was not true (e.g. when the Irish or Thai periodical was meant) the editors of those articles seemed to not be aware of the U.S. periodical.  (This makes sense, incidentally, as this periodical is not entirely well known even in the U.S.)  In short, the old situation was that there were a ton of links to a disambiguation page, which is to be avoided, but in this new situation, I think we'll eventually see a ton of links to simply the wrong thing, which strikes me as worse.

A vast majority of those were in bibliographies, where a web article from The Nation was referenced.

"== Some Main Mechanisms for Transitional Justice in Burma ==

By Aung Thiha

What is transitional justice? Before we talk about some main mechanisms for transitional justice for future Burma, we are supposed to know what transitional justice is. It is mainly subject to the human rights abuses in the past. The most important thing is to search for a justice for both victims and perpetrators involved in the past without any bias. Therefore, we are supposed to find appropriate ways to help those who had seriously suffered from human rights abuses in the past. It is also important to handle those who committed the human rights abuses in the past in appropriate ways. We have to find the truth from both victims and perpetrators without taking sides. It is unquestionable that both opposition groups and military generals have hardliners. For instance, U Kyi Maung, who is one of the members of the National League of Democracy (NLD), used to answer the question made by journalists, saying that they were going to establish international military tribunals like the ones in Germany (8th August 1945) and to try military generals who committed the crimes in the past. It was really a threat for the military generals who are afraid of prosecution. As a result, it can lead to internecine circumstances. 

In relation to the transitional justice in Burma, we consider some main mechanisms to create justice in transitional period. First, in advance we have to investigate the details as to the violations of human rights committed by the military regime in the past so as to become aware of when, where and how they happen. The investigation can include individuals or institutions involved in the past human rights abuses. There can be a lot of obstacles or delay in investigating the abuses. We can also get tangible information from the government files, mass graves and testimonies. For instance, we can investigate the abuses by uncovering the mass graves carried out by the Burmese army in the jungle and by identifying the bodies; who they were, how and when they were executed. It will be very helpful for us to do something against the perpetrators during the transitional period. We also have to make sure that we share information collected with the public so that they can help follow the cases. 

Second, regarding to the prosecution we are still undecided whether we are supposed to offer an amnesty to the military generals, or we ought to try them at the international military tribunal like in Germany. Actually, what the military generals fear most is a prosecution. If we prosecute them, the circle of retaliation against each other will not be able to end, but will also delay of transferring political power to the opposition parties or the obstruction of Burma’s political progress. As a consequence, the civilians will be victims again. Furthermore, prosecution against the military generals is irrelevant to the current political situation in Burma. It is not realistic. On the other hand, if we forgive the generals for their abuses and offer an amnesty to them with a view to the development of the country as a whole, it seems to ignore or overlook the people who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. They will not be satisfied with us in power, and we will lack credibility. In some cases, we find it difficult to prosecute the perpetrators because they, at the same time, are both perpetrators and victims (e.g child soldiers who are forcibly recruited by the SPDC). It is not always possible to regard them as criminals. Therefore, both sides are supposed to think about the whole circumstance and try to negotiate the issues for the sake of the whole country and its people rather than focusing on obtaining political power or personal feelings. It is also important to try to reduce grievances being rooted in both sides. Prosecuting the military generals is not a good solution for the group in power in the long term.  

Third, in the transitional period we can also use civil sanction against those who were involved in the human rights abuses in the past. As I already mentioned, by letting people look at the files that include the details of past human rights abuses, they can distinguish the victims and perpetrators. Then, they can prevent anyone who they think were supporters or collaborators in the past human rights abuses from being involved in future political role by means of demonstration. By not allowing the supporters or collaborators involved in the past human rights abuses to be involved in future politics, we also have to show that we respect the dignity of the people and do not overlook or ignore their sufferings from the past. 

Fourth, reparation also creates the justice for those who had suffered from severe human rights abuses in the past. For instance, in Germany the government compens",0,0,0

Since the sulfate is the most common salt of ferroin, I suggest that we either (1) move the article to Iron(II) tris(phenanthroline) sulfate (seems cumbersome) or (2) tweak the current article to focus mainly on the sulfate (the same CAS#) but this way we can discuss solubility, structure, prep, while acknowledging that the properties in soln are independent of the anion.",0,0,0
"Well, the problem is that our articles aren't supposed to give advice to anyone, per se. Looking at your contributions to the article Road traffic safety, they read more like a step-by-step how-to manual than an encyclopedia article.  What I would recommend for you to do is this: try writing an article about this in your own userspace first.  You can do this by , creating the page, and using it for your article.  Try to focus on capturing an encyclopedic style: avoid step-by-step instructions, don't use first- and second-person pronouns (I, you, we, etc.), try to be descriptive rather than prescriptive.  Try to find some good reliable sources on this subject; use what they say in your article without using their words to say it.  Since this is a userspace draft, you have all the time you need to work on it, so take your time.  When you think you're done, you can submit your article to articles for creation, where you can get some feedback on it before it goes live.  If all goes well, and the AFC reviewer approves, it'll become a real article. Let me know if you think I can help with this, I'd be happy to lend what few skills I have.  ⚇♔",0,0,0

I'm archiving this section because the pettiness simply is non-productive.  Let's try to figure out something that we can do constructively with these articles.  An A7 CSD was clearly wrong, but let's face it, most of these articles deserve to die.  The question is how to handle this constructively, which is what is going on above.  Let's stop quibbling over the rules and work towards getting something constructive done.-' NO! I'm Spartacus! 

Steve, I can tell you one way which will not work for the articlesand that is to do as you have done, and deleted some of them as G4, as if the AfD had closed the way you wanted it, not as keep. And the many you deleted (as did Orderinchaos) as dg-a7, non-notable person, in total defiance of WP:CSDA7.    The closer told you the right waynominate for deletion the ones you want to, individually.   I've asked you both on your talk page to restore them.  Sarah, can you explain to them about the inadvisability of outright   defiance of Wikipedia policy?  After we get this cleanup up, I'll talk a little about proper merging/redirect. As you may guess, I shall almost certainly to revert any redirects or merges except with consensus for each article. That does not mean I might not agree to some , most, or even all of them if procedure is followed properly. '  
I would suggest that threatening the community to edit war against it when it is trying to find a solution to a problem and work through differing and even opposing points of view to mutual satisfaction, is neither a wise nor an advisable course of action. Your behaviour at the past AfD is already under scrutiny - you openly defied policy in ways I have never actually seen from an admin who managed to keep his bit thereafter. VirtualSteve and myself closed articles which had been recreated against consensus, the recent AfD offered no opinion on any individual article and was a reaction to the mass nom (which, while I supported, I did not initiate nor did I think it was the absolute best way to resolve the situation - though as it has gotten the right people talking to each other, may yet result in progress). A bit of cooperation rather than snarky threats to disrupt and offline abuse of contributors would go a long way from you, DGG. Orderinchaos 
No, but I can explain to you about the inadvisability of outright defiance of Wikipedia's policy on wheel and edit warring. The edit war policy states """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a content dispute."""" Strangely enough that sounds an awful lot like what you're threatening to do. You've certainly got a check on the """"confrontational"""", """"combative"""" and """"non-productive"""" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning. As is the arrogance implicit in the statement that you'll return to lecture us poor shmoes on how to do merges and redirects the """"proper"""" way. 8| You don't have any more authority here than any one of us and your behaviour regarding this subject has been outrageous and disruptive. I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up. You really should know better and I'm appalled by your behaviour. Sarah 
I've also received some interesting info in recent days about unrelated disputes, and have made the relevant authorities aware. The odd bit is that there isn't even a dispute here as such between the different active, editing parties here - merely differing positions on notability which can actually be negotiated. The editors who come to this as fans have said they are - 1. willing to work with us; 2. willing to help with content.

 Re:CUplex 

Hello Tungilik!

Unfortunately, you cannot, even tough you work and have access information at the City of North Battleford because no original research says """"original research used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist"""" which means if an article has no sources it cannot be notable and hence counted as original research per General notability guideline.

Make sure that your sources must be reliable, if you want to know if a source is reliable. WP:SOURCE says """"a source material must have been published, the definition of which for our purposes is made available to the public in some form. Unpublished materials are not considered reliable"""" You can use university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals and mainstream newspapers as reliable sources. Never use blogs as sources as WP:NEWSBLOG says """"Never use blog posts that are left by readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources.""""

Wikipedia strongly prefer """"free"""" files, wherever possible. When no """"free"""" file exist, it sometimes to ask a permission to use a non-free (copyright-protected) file under the """"fair use"""" provision. Ideally, most free files should be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons instead of Wikipedia. 

In uploading images, only logged in users with autoconfirmed accounts are allowed to upload images. Now, you first find out whether the image is legal in the United States (where the Wikipedia servers are located) also, if the image has not been released (to your knowledge) under a license, and is still under copyright you must gain permission to use the image from the copyright holder. Next if you're finish, determine which image copyright tag is applicable for your file.

In the procedure of uploading it, You can upload an image by using the Upload file link on the left side of the main page under Toolbox. Use good filenames because some filenames (such as highly generic filenames produced automatically by digital cameras) are disallowed, and attempting to use them will generate an error message.

Example of good file names:
 """":Image:City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg""""
 """"Sir John Betjeman (1906-1984).jpg""""

Example of bad file names:

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk)

Claiming that the official title of a legislative act (TEA-21) that uses 21st (one mention that is not our writings and is something out of our control), is grounds for reverting 6 others in an article that is already """"internally consistent"""" as you put it, that is disingenuous and some would consider it disruptive editing. If you have any further comments, raise it on the talk page.  This is not a matter of ownership, it's just that these petty format issues (whether it be dates, centuries spelled or numbered, etc.) are aggravating and unnecessary, and it's audacity to insist upon it when your claims for it are baseless.  This contact is a courtesy and will be my one and only time. If you continue to revert, this will become a matter for WP:ANI.   """,0,0,0

Formed in 1878, Everton were founder members of The Football League in 1888 and [avoid """"and's"""", very amateurish] won their first [avoid """"their"""", very amateurish] league championship three years later. [date of formation and winning not connected, should be in separate paras] Following five league titles and two FA Cups, Everton experienced a lull in the post-war period until a revival in the 1960s, winning two league championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their [avoid """"their"""", very amateurish] most recent period of success, with two league victories, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup—their first continental trophy. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.

Since 2000, the club has annually recognised successful former players, nominating an """"Everton Giant"""" at the beginning of each season.

The club have a large fanbase and regularly attracts high attendances, averaging over 36,000, 90% of stadium capacity.[2] Everton have a notable rivalry with neighbours Liverpool F.C. and matches between the two sides are known as the Merseyside Derby. Liverpool F.C. were formed in 1892 by a breakaway group consisting of Everton's former president and several players. The dispute also resulted in Everton leaving Anfield, their original home ground.

Details2: I can understand that you would like to have the whole thing rewritten to cast a more favorable light on TFI but your statement that nothing is all black or white does not fit with regards to your description of FFing. Berg's letters, his language, Marias language and letters, letters such as """"Make It Pay"""" """"God's Whores"""", The King Arthur Series, and many many more, make it clear that FFing was prostitution with a sordid twist of Jesus being behind it all. I think if someone from NAMBLA said """"Our detractors say we molest little boys but we say we show them love, nothing is black and white"""" that a minority of people, probably molesters themselves, would see it that way.
I don't think the public gets a fair view of TFI since they don't have access here to read for themselves the full content of those letters and many others. Letters like #3029JNR- Loving Jesus Part 3-JETTS is but one letter that has statements showing that certain practices should not be revealed to outsiders. If TFI has nothing to hide, """"Burn After Reading"""" letters would never have been necessary. Despite precautions, publications continue to leak from TFI as people jump ship.

 Tie-break rules in basketball  

Can you give me the exact rules of this situation because I found this:

1) If 2 teams have the same record, the team that won the head to head game wins
the tie breaker.
2) If there are more than 2 teams with the same record, then the tie breaker will be
decided by the point difference in all games played. Please look at the chart below
for an example. All 3 teams ended with 2 wins and 2 loses.
# Team A Team B Team C1 Win + 2  Lose 15   Win +252Lose –10 Lose –9 Lose –33Win +5  Win +7  Lose –24 Lose –2  Win +10  Win + 11Diff. –5  –9  +31

So in this example, Team C would win the tie breaker with +31, Team A will be second
with -5, and Team B will be last with -9.
So, if this right , the standing in Euroleague 2009–10 is also correct.connect """,0,0,0

Warning, stop vandalism and say why you are so stupid nationalist?""""

Sorry if you don't get the reply right away. The problem is I am not sure I understand your request. Since it is so, I will take the liberty and divide it into three parts:
warning
request to stop (vandalism)
request to answer a question

Answer is this:
 .... Warning? As in threat?
 .... You want me to stop? Is it vandalism that you want me to stop? If to both questions the answer is yes, then my reply is a question: why do you write that vandalism is what I do?
 .... This is the toughest to comprehend. You ask why, and actually I am not sure. You write the syntagma stupid nationalist. If you think that I am a stupid nationalist, maybe you could think over. At least for the """"stupid part"""" of the syntagma. As for the part that writes nationalist, I only could agree with you with the meaning that I'm trying to defend my habitat. Ofcourse, this what I write is from my POV.

Not necessarily.  I believe SD 2.0 has tighter electrical specifications than SD 1.x (such as lower voltage tolerances and higher current tolerances) so a SD 1.x device may, but would not necessarily, qualify as an SD 2.0 device.  It would need to be meet the electrical specs of SD 2.0 before it could be able to offically support SDHC and carry the SDHC logo.  It is possible that some SD 1.x devices will already meet this spec just because they were designed well from the start, but they would need to be tested to ensure they meet the SD 2.0 electrical spec and also have a firmware upgrade.  136.186.1.185  04:08, 1 July 2008",0,0,0

Which words do you object to? ➨ ❝ЯEDVERS❞ a sweet and tender hooligan

We don't block to punish. In fact, we shouldn't seek to punish here at all. And of course blocking someone who is already inflamed will cause them to leave/detonate: that's one of the many reasons we don't issue cool-down blocks any more. ➨ ❝ЯEDVERS❞ a sweet and tender hooligan  

You were the one to use the word """"punishment"""". So you're now saying that such blocks are not punishment after all? ➨ ❝ЯEDVERS❞ a sweet and tender hooligan

This article as a whole is subject to a confused identity and I have no idea what to make of it. When I have insane nationalists blaming an entire ethnic group with inherited sin and racially abusing me by declaring me a non-native of where I was fucking born and bought up, then I start to wonder why I should care in the first place.

Some of our traditions and place-names are of """"West Welsh"""" Celtic origins, most of us probably have Celtic DNA but we are most certainly not Welsh or Celtic!

I've met Irish Republicans, Scottish nationalists...and I find them more agreeable and less inclined to automatic hatred once they know my stance on things, but when it comes to general views of the English from the Welsh side of the nationalist coin...oh by. It's a 1500-year-old blood feud. As for how the worst of the English view the Welsh - it's usually just stereotype mockery or snobbishness, and it's very effing common.

Another likely conflict of interest matter with respect to Rick Warren and Saddleback Church

Hi Steve. I don't mean to dump gasoline on an already difficult situation, but you might say that duty calls.

 The contributions list for CarverM indicates that he has almost exclusively been editing articles that are in some way connected with Saddleback Church, including Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Life (Warren's book), The Purpose Driven Church (also a book by Warren), Doug Fields (a pastor at Saddleback), and Richard Abanes (a lay minister and former staffer at Saddleback).

 There is a rather remarkable mockup of a version of the Saddleback Church page in CarverM's user space, here. It is written as a promotional piece and certainly wouldn't qualify as an actual article. Why is it there?

 I'll note that the username CarverM bears a resemblance to the name Mark Carver. Carver was at one time (2006) described as """"a top aide to mega-church pastor and best selling author Rick Warren."""" Throwing """"Mark Carver"""" and """"Rick Warren"""" into Google yields 290 hits that I'll hesitate to characterize, but there are strong indications that CarverM is potentially not just another editor, and may be tightly connected with Warren.

"""Not every sentence needs a citation, one citation can be provided for several sentences. What you are proposing is to completely delete everything from the article representing the view of majority of Iranians and the government that the elections were not rigged and leave the article with only green movement propaganda. Firtsly I want to make it clear there was no real proof at all, the """"proof"""" provided were: a comparison of Ahmadinejad's 2005 first round results per province (in which 7 major candidates competed and none had a majority) with his 2009 results per province, which ofcourse showed and increase for Ahmadinejad votes everywhere and than the claim that this should be impossible, which """"proves"""" Mousavi won. A claim by Mousavi office that the """"actual results"""" leaked and showed him with 19 milion votes and Ahmadinejad with only 5 milion votes which contradicts the green movement's claims that the eelection results weren't counted at all, because the results were in (supposedly) much to quickly, which is their other """"major proof"""" that the results were rigged. Another """"proof"""" is the myth of """"all Azeris would automaticly vote for Mousavi, disregaring all politics and voting purely on ethnic basis"""" (which should """"prove"""" that the election was rigged as Ahmadinejad won in Tabriz), but at the same time the Persians are not gonna vote ethnicly for some reason unknown to us, infact they were all gonna vote for Mousavi the non-Persian. Other than these flawed theories presented by the Green movement you've got a few claims by them that anonymous government workers have admitted the election was rigged, the problem being that none of this can ever ben confirmed and the assumption that the fact that 100,000 people demonstrated in a city of 14,000,000 (metropolian area) - although nowhere else in the country the Greens could get over 1000 people - should make everyone believe that it is sooo obviously clear tha a vast majority of Iran's 74 milion people support this man. And all of these weak claims are mentioned throughout all articles related (and even articles hardly related) to the elections and/or green movement. Now if this is the only """"proof"""" they have (which it is), why would pro-American governments and the media in their country's take it all so seriously? Simple, politics are politics. There has been a smear-campaign against Ahmadinejad, in western media ever since he got in power and against Iran ever since the revolution, because the Iranian politics do not coincide with American geo-strategic interests. Why do you think their camera crews prior to the elections only interviewed university students in Northern Tehran which spoke fluent English, while no other city, region or population group's views were ever shown on American news? Because they wanted to create an image that Mousavi is more populair, while infact he wasn't, as the fully legitimate results show.

"No-AfD proposal 
Consider the background to Mtking and Newmanoconnor immediately agreeing to your no-AfD proposal. Just a week ago they wouldn't have even given you the time of day. The current situation has them very scared and they'll pretty much do anything do anything to fast-track their terrible plan through. This is why they're talking 1-2 week timelines whereas before they've been been screwing with the MMA community for months with an incomplete doc while AfD'ing everything in sight. Of course, short-tracking necessarily means they'll railroad the MMA voices against. If they don't get the short-track, their plan is essentially dead, which is why they'll show a tiny bit of leeway in the short term to get what they want in the long term. What's most notable is that even if they get what they want, it doesn't mean they don't AfD again right after they get approval. Their plan has no brightline rules, and it's vague and open to interpretation (which is why AfD are effective now). The situation after will be no better, but we'll be stuck with it while they're not saddled with anything.

YOU PEOPLE ARE AT IT AGAIN.

He first started achieving major public notoriety in early 2007, when he made complaints of harassment at Columbia University, against students who allegedly called him a """"baby killer"""" for being in the military

No, he first made his complaints in early 2006. This gained him attention at Columbia. Then he wrote articles for a student newspaper, a military newspaper and on some right-wing blogs. That got him noticed by national right-wing media, i.e., Fox News. In late 2006, left-wing students publicized his pornography background. It was largely ignored.

Then he got the CPAC award on the same day that Ann Coulter made her comment about John Edwards. That caused the gay blogs to dig up what had been reported in late '06. The story of CPAC applauding Coulter while honoring a gay porn star and hooked spread to non-gay liberal blogs, and then to MSNBC's Countdown. That's how it became a national story.

In the ensuing controversy, it became public knowledge that Sanchez himself had been a performer in homosexual/bisexual[4] adult films in the early 1990s. The story became popular in the blogosphere, especially among homosexual bloggers who insinuated rumors about the details of Sanchez's past.

Sanchez appears in 38 gay porn movies. About 15 of them are originals, the rest re-compilations. Of the 38 videos, one is titled """"Bi Conflict,"""" but in that video Sanchez performs homosexual acts. Sanchez has never had anything other than gay sex on film. These are not """"homosexual/bisexual films."""" He is a gay porn actor who appeared in gay porn films for gay viewers.

There has been no """"insinuation"""" of """"rumors."""" Rather, there has been reporting of solid evidence. Sanchez prostituted under the name Excellent Top between 1999 and 2002, and operated the No Regrets Massage service, a front for prostitution, in 2004. He directly admitted prostitution in an appearance on the Alan Colmes show on March 8, 2007, and in an article published the same day on Salon.com

Sanchez revealed that Countdown never bothered to contact him before running the television report. Countdown sourced several gay blogs to complete the report, as well as committed left-wing ideologue Max Blumenthal who claimed that Sanchez was apart of a greater """"an underground railroad"""" for fallen gay right-wingers.

Calling Bluemental """"a committed left-wing ideologue"""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor script. It is an outrageous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. So is saying that Sanchez """"revealed"""" that Countdown """"never bothered"""" to contact him.

Critics charge that Sanchez has given conflicting statements about rumors from anonymous bloggers.

The use of the phrase """"rumors from anonymous bloggers"""" is straight out of an O'Reilly Factor, an is an outraegous violation of Wikipedia's purported neutrality. First off, they are not rumors. Remember, the so-called """"rumors"""" have proven true. Secondly, most bloggers are anonymous. This does not by itself indict them or the information they provide, any more than a newspaper story without a byline indicts the newspaper that prints it.

In an op-ed piece in Salon.com, Sanchez likened porn to prostitution, he subsequently said he wanted to draw that same analogy on his first appearances on Colmes Radio show.""""[24]

First off, whatever he claimed that he had """"wanted"""" to do on Colmes is immaterial. The Colmes interview stands on its own. Secondly, he made the claim about what he """"wanted"""" to do on a blog. But this time, it was on a right-wing """"ex-gay"""" blog. Since when does Wikipedia elevation right-wing ex-gay blogs to a superior status? Some """"neutrality"""" you people show!

A later report by the same writer appeared on April 1, 2007, indicating that Sanchez was also being investigated by the Marine Corps for fraudulently soliciting funds from two organizations, the United War Veteran's Council and U-Haul, in order to fund a deployment to Iraq which he never actually made. Sanchez has denied the charges; saying that he never collected money from either organization.[25]

Excuse me, but Sanchez's denial of fraudulent solicitation is a non-denial. In fact, Sanchez admitted soliciting the money. Whether or not he collected it has no bearing on whether or not he solicited it. Those are two separate issues. Extortion doesn't have to succeed to be extortion.

There is a larger point to be made here, which is that Sanchez's various explataions have been a circus of multi-contradictions. It is not """"neutral"""" to split the difference. Facts are neutral. So report the facts. How hard is it to report the facts?""",0,0,0

I regret to inform you that because of deletionist scum such as Gavin Collins and J Milburn, I am planning to terminate my life. You see, Wikipedia was my life, and these deletionist bastards have ruined and deleted everything that I have worked so very hard to create. I spent over three years contributing to Wikipedia, improving the site, sacrificing grades in school to add to a revolutionary encyclopedia, but because of these low-life dip-shits whom I abhor in every molecule of my body, I have discovered that it was all for nothing. So I end my life, and I hope this will bring the wrath and resentment of the world down upon these deletionist jackasses.

I'm not sure I get your point.  Readers of Wikipedia aren't required to be familiar with all of its policies and guidelines, and so it can't be assumed that they will know about the notability requirements, which are in fact only a guideline.  Moreover, there are plenty of organizations which don't go out of their way to publicize themselves yet are still notable, and aggrandizing connotates way more than just publicity.  Including 'self-aggrandizing' doesn't at all suggest that that's their primary motive.  As well, there could be notable trolls or notable trolling groups who don't self-aggrandize, and certainly not to the extent and in the joie de vire manner the GNAA does.  Indeed, many trolling groups and individuals try to obscure or hide the fact that they're trolls, which often makes their activities more successful.

Rest assured, I am becoming increasing familiar with your legendary and oft-disclosed lack of caring, which seems to be a recurring issue in your life and recently published remarks.

And I appreciate that your dreadfully provocative remarks elsewhere may well be a transparent attempt to solicit the kind of caring that you apparently crave.

You have a keen sense of awareness of those who respond with a tiny measure of empathy and compassion to your repeated (dare  I say desperate?) cries for attention.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",0,1,1

Fair use rationale for Image:Fetch! with ruff ruffman.jpg

:Image:Fetch! with ruff ruffman.jpg is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Robert Seymour (illustrator) v. Seymour Controversy 

REF: Fribbler. 19th September 2008. EDIT: (It's not """"the"""" Jane Seymour. It was his wife.) 

The fact of Robert’s wife ( and daughter ) named Jane Seymour, in comparison with “the” Jane Seymour, must be considered when analyzing evidences, motives and causations of Robert’s death. 

“The” Jane Seymour wife of Henry VIII was mother to the last English King Edward VI. (English law forbade matrilineal succession) As determined in the will of Henry VIII, Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (b.1561), his 3 sons; 3 daughters and brother, were all named as successors to the English Throne, (then again after Elizabeth I, and James I.) 

The 1st evidence of a Seymour (Beauchamp) ancestry being usurped* occurred in the German 1st reign (matrilineal descent) of King George 1st. His Prime Minister; Walpole ('his' crest representing the House of Wettin – Queen Victoria) usurped the confiscated McDermott – Beauchamp Arms (Chevron; Cross Crosslet, and motto Dieu et mon Droit.) 

During the childless reign of King William IV, Robert Seymour’s suicide verdict literally determined him as a felon, and for his crime, his properties were forfeited to William IV, for the German 2nd reign (Victoria’s matrilineal descent) of her Sax Coburg-Gotha heirs. 

Thus, the (Seymour) succession of Edward VI; went to (Sax Coburg-Gotha) Edward VII. 24 September 2008 (UTC)

"""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  

I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.

But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

The Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an enemy of Spider-Man. The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man's vast rogues' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])

Novels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.

Fictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on supe",0,0,0

My numerous beefs with the template:
Poor coding
Clear:right; is preferable to unnecessary line breaks
a single text-align:center;"""" is preferable to repeating needlessly align=center for every cell
A width definition is preferable to margins, and more commona cross wikipedia.
there is absolutely no need to have the comment be inserted in every page as it is specifically intended only for the template page.

There is no apparent reason to have a category in the template. the category would be just as well put independantly.
The link in the header was misleading as implying an article limited to western Russia. Unless Kremlin actually is, but I doubt that, and can't really tell anyway.
No background color in the header, unlike 90% of wikipedia footers
Picture enlarging header unnecesssarily, at the very least it should be reduced and move in the content section of the footer.
80% is unnecearily small for a simple footer like this. Most wikipedia footers do very well with 90%

Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet.

It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring.

If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying """"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S."""" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.

 The best response is no response? 

It seems that every time i try to talk to anybody around here, things end up deleted or changed. Chronic problem. At least this time
it was actually apparently you who did it. Nice change.
Are you just going to delete and ignore the people who are trying to
get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems?

Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here. You don't have a creative or collaborative encyclopedia; You have a psycholigcal war
zone.

What are you going to do about it?
My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory,
Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense.
I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements.

LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational
service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your
problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.

Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are.

It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress
the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal
is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas.

Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama.
People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them
for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is.

Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry
and to the point message you failed to answer.

Wikipedia IS evil
[23]

It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in """"neutral"""" language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this """"Randian"""" Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order.

"﻿Sensual Pleasures of the MindItalic text

There are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. Money can’t buy it, you can’t see it or hold it, outer
packaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. Sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within.  It is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. It is born there and lives there.

Since it is a feeling rather than a physical event, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences.  Knowledge, intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it, what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. A conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind.    

All of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. There are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. (Emotional Buttons)  Pushing those buttons engenders our partner's sensory and sexual experience. We do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. Where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge, intuition and creativity an individual possesses. Nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s.  It’s freelance flight.

Knowledge is power! Getting to know your partner and what makes her/him tick and tingle is the first step. The ability to
unearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reaction
indicating you have your finger on a button (hot spot). Finding all of those buttons, exploring the endless possibilities and
discovering the wondrous places they lead, takes patience and thought, but the rewards are immeasurable.

Having well honed intuition is a valuable asset. Liken it, if you will, to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. If you ‘know’ what your partner needs, wants and desires without her/him having to explain it all, then you hold a powerful advantage. Possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex, in general, offers a continual win, win proposition

Being gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. Desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. Spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. If they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. Avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. If it wasn't good the first time, why would anyone want to repeat it?  Taking your partner to a place where she/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. That is the stuff heroes are made of.

Sexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation, sexual pleasures, or through mind play and manipulation A physical presence, a verbal exchange, a mere mental/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’, a place of arousal and euphoria.

Sensual/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. Rituals and sensual tasks , while away from your
partner can help keep the buttons pushed, the bond strong, keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on an
ongoing basis. Keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.

Altered states....
1-Sexuality.....intensely 'turned on' riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passion
2-Endorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.
3-Euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.
5-Head space......spellbound/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful place
6-Nirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through 'losing oneself'......total freedom through total loss of control.

All sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe.",0,0,0

 Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka 
Hello stephen,
If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.

I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! 

Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.

Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  """"i'll report you"""" and/or """"you will be banned"""". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. 

If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.

If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.
If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.

 Clarification 

Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  
Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.

1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.
2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.
Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him """"Haredi"""" as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been """"Haredi"""" (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  """,0,0,0

Hi Greg Jack,

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases. This one for example is certainly not a paid release: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-opinions-online-amiritenet-amirite/ Makeuseof is a very well known site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeUseOf

I don't think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesn't mention adversarial on it. Also Amirite's twitter has over 62,000 followers which is significant: https://twitter.com/amiritecom And if you type Amirite.com and Amirite.net into google this brings more than 5 million results.

"""My decision to pursue graduate study in the United States is underscored by my desire to be a part of the graduate program at your institution. Purdue University offers the flexibility needed for such a vast and rapidly changing field. The research facilities and the faculty at the university are par excellent. 

Communications is an industry that has changed our lives. In a very short period it has changed the way we have looked at things since centuries. It is one industry that is going to shape our future for centuries to come. Hence my desire to do masters in electrical engineering with communications as my major. 

My interest in electronics blossomed during my high school years. It was the time when technology had begun to make an impact on the lives of people in India. Hence engineering with electronics as my major was the first choice for my undergraduate studies. Right since the beginning of my undergraduate study electronics is a subject that has fascinated me with its power of applications. The subjects that I have studied include Linear Electronics, Digital Electronics. These laid the foundation for my courses in Electronic Communication & Communication Systems at a later stage. My undergraduate studies already focus on the communications aspect of electronics. A masters degree in electrical engineering with communications as major field is the next logical step. 

For the past four months I have been working as a project trainee at the Indian Institute for Advanced Electronics. I am working on the design and development of a """"PC Controlled Digital Serial Data Generator"""". This short stint has given me invaluable practical experience. It has given me the confidence to pursue a masters degree and also kindled a desire to do research. 

During the course of my work at IIAE, I have come across several scientists. Most of them work in different areas of communications. Interactions with them have made me realize the vastness and the scope of communications. My discussions with them convinced me that specializing in communications will suit me very well. 

The subject of research which interests me very much is spread spectrum communication systems. Coding theory and combinations is another research subject which arouses my curiosity. The subject Communication Theory which I am studying at present introduces these topics in theory. I am eager to find out more about the applications of coding theory to spread spectrum communication systems. 

In addition I have been a student member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.) for the past three years. Through its workshops/seminars and publications like the 'The Spectrum' it has exposed me to a lot of emerging technologies in the field of communications. 

It is a strong belief in my family that the American education system has the best to offer in the whole world. This belief arises out of the experience that my parents had when they did their Masters of Science in the University of Pennsylvania during the years 1967-69. If I can get an opportunity to be a part of that intellectually stimulating environment, I am sure my talents will be put to optimal use. 

India is a developing country with an enormous potential in the information technology business. To serve the needs of this developing industry and more important its vast population, communications is going to become of utmost importance. Thus conditions here are very conducive to supplement my aspirations when I return after completing my graduate studies.""",0,0,0

"The link in the most recent comment by JohnInDC is one to a site with links to sites describing the U.S. Capitol. Whoever designed that link may not have known that the plan was  Ellicott's, rather than L'Enfant's. That also seems to be the case at Arlington Cemetery, where a historical marker in front of L'Enfant's grave illustrates Ellicott's Plan, rather than L'Enfant's original plan.  As L'Enfant objected to Ellicott's revisions in his letters, he would probably not be very happy about this misidentification. Fortunately, his grave is covered by a slab containing a copy of a portion of his own plan.  However, the public usually only sees the copy of Ellicott's plan (or revision). 

As to the caption of the pictures on the Wikipedia pages, the people who have commented above should all visit the website describing the Library of Congress' holdings of L'Enfant's and Ellicott's plans in the Library's catalog at http://lccn.loc.gov/95860578.   The summary of the holdings states:   “Summary: Includes plans by Pierre L'Enfant (facsimile maps published in 1887 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey) and Andrew Ellicott (1792) and … “.  

In its most definitive site, the Library of Congress therefore identifies the plan in the Wikipedia pages as Ellicott’s plan.  I will leave it to others to revise the caption on the plan in the Wikepedia pages, as I do not want to revise it again myself.",0,0,0

"The text of the article could have been taken from Tudjman era Croatian propaganda press. The consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality, or revalue the widely accepted view of Croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased. Some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing (particularly the plight of the city's inhabitants of Serbian nationality - about half of the total number - in the city subject to Croatian military rule, or the very existence thereof) parts of the text are clearly self-contradictory (the Croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed, yet they still manage to down 20 warplanes) and full of dubious propaganda cliches (the backbone of JNA was broken at Vukovar). One does not need to be an expert on war in the Balkans to note these shortcomings. Naturally, this does not mean that we should subscribe to the Serbian propaganda of the time - an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from ICTY proceedings, from well known western reporters present at or near the scene (Misha Glenny), and from other sources. Actually, merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this.

Your reverts of the Ankit Fadia article state that you're """"removing material not supported by sources or cited to unreliable sources"""" So with that, there are 1741 mentions of Chennai Online, do you plan on deleting those passages in Wikipedia articles
mentioning Chennai Online as a source?

Granted there are one mention of Wendy McAuliffe and its in the Ankit Fadia article but there are 35,700 results for """"Wendy McAuliffe"""" ZDNet in Google, and at her current venture about page http://www.populatedigital.com/people/ mentions """"Wendy began her career as a journalist for ZDNet, the UK’s leading online technology newswire, during which time she became a leading authority in online privacy and child protection online."""" so that's another unreliable sources?!?

Surely an article about Ankit Fadia by Suelette Dreyfus is a reliable source, but you nixed that too.

You point to the notability page and revert the page, and I see in that document that Wikipedia is not a promotional medium, the way that article is after you revert the page, it turns into a promotional medium for Ankit Fadia, without the other articles supporting that Ankit Fadia is a phony, then have the issue of unclear notability to which having an article about Ankit Fadia. If notability requires verifiable evidence, how many mainstream and researched articles pointing out are needed to point out that Ankit Fadia is a verifiable phony? 

I can't take these donation drives for Wikipedia seriously if the basis for articles on Wikipedia are given to people with no grasp of their field, and hardcore plagiarism of other people's work without and accepting them as your own original work.
The research is there, maybe I'm not the editor for putting this together, but either Wikipedia should delete the article or stop sugar coating this article as a one sided promotional medium for Ankit Fadia.

I know the what the official Star Wars databank says, and it can still be left open to interpretation. Just because the lightning caused his face to change doesn't mean it physically deformed his facial tissue. I also don't care about what Pablo Hidalgo says, as this is still a secondary source.

No. The lightning burning his tissue theory doesn't make any sense in accordance to the behavior previously exhibited by Force Lightning interacting with the human body.

No. Just because the lightning was deflected doesn't make its effects on the human body any different. Seriously, why do you think his Sith eyes appeared along with the changes?

Errors on the French Wikipedia
I was just looking at the Nunavut and Liste des communautés au Nunavut and noticed that there were several errors.

The Inuit names for the following places are not the official names. A list of official names can be found here, although the spelling of Igloolik is odd.
Qamani’tuaq should be Baker Lake
Naujatt should be Repulse Bay
Kangiqtiniq should be Rankin Inlet
Akviligjuaq is another name for Kugaaruk
Ikaluktutiak should be Cambridge Bay

The """"Liste des communautés au Nunavut"""" has a link to Inuits Netsilik but they are a group of people rather than a community. Amadjuak, Amadjuak, Nunavut, should probably say that it's a former community.

There is nothing inherently POV about discussing Israeli violence against Palestinian children. It is a fact. It is a recognized problem as the data in the article reflects.

On reflection, the 19th Century section actually is a bit bloated with non-relevant stuff. The issue of slavery being based on assumed inferiority is obviously core to the controversy, but there is also a lot of waffle including arbitrary observations and one guy who merely quoted Herodotus in his dictionary. This section is basically the longest in the article, and it thus gives undue weight to stuff that is not really core. I propose to thin this section down to focus on the controverial issue around slavery. Any objections?   
Herodotus is in the Classical section and is quoted from Du Bois. Regarding the length of that 19th section, I have no comments for the moment. Actually, I see other sections with the same length.

 corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid 

Canof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as """"steroids"""" by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. 

removed section and reasons

TABThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.
TABThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.
TABAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea",0,0,0

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0,0,0

Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth. Again, who says the whole range has to originate from admixture instead of slow evolution of diversity (which decreases on its way to Eurasia, so you'd have to hypothesize on they instantly loose diversity in comparison with others, including Native American groups who weren't even there long enough to become depigmented.",0,0,0

"""== plants ==

I find the first sentences of this article very strange. I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   
It looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  
I see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  
A nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   
I think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  
The article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   
I removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying """"Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish"""" because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   

I removed """"focusing on plant-based foods"""", since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets """"focus"""" on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  
It would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  
What about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   
Fungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' (T↔C) 
Correct, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  
(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement """"vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods""""? -  
Can you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: """"We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products."""" Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.

The translation as such is fairly accurate, but there is problem with diffent contexts. Detain/Häktad has different meaning especillay from a legal point of view, but I think that is understable and can be accepted. That the word Rape has different meaning is harder to pass by without clarifying. I have worked much with the article om sv:wp om rape, and know that English and US law defines this very differently from Swedish law and it is possible some mentioning of this would be necessary to make it understable for a person not from the Nordic countries. Also I think, but am not cetrain, that the actual charges are made in a more general wordings, more making references to several legal clauses. And that, if the interogation goes to a legal case, the actual wording of the charge then would be more specific, as one of the aim of the """"prestudy"""" is for the prosecuter to be more certain of what legal cluses to persue. So in some ways to includee this into the article would clarify some parts, but in orher ways it could cause even more confusion (but on a higher level..).

OurMed
Hi! My name is Marilena Tsangaroulis and I'm on the Volunteer Committee of an online healthcare movement called """"OurMed"""".

At OurMed, we're committed to creating an interactive health site that uses a global, collaborative tool like with Wikipedia but goes an important step furtherwe verify all content by healthcare professionals like yourself.

We launched the Wikipedia version last year (OurMed's Site) , and this year we’re adding a host of important features that will make Ourmed an extensive site for unbiased and user driven clinical research/tools for physicians as well as user friendly resources for patients and consumers. You can have a peek at our new design here: (Our New Site in Development)

Although we have a section on editorials in the new site, the new one will emphasize non-commercial, unbiased informationall entirely free. The organization is governed by a non-profit Board made up of Healthcare professionals, the former head of Wikipedia, Florence Devouard, former accountant of Wikipedia Oleta McHenry and other professionals.

Here's a short video of our plans: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAqbMl1dVk

Please let me know if you'd like to learn morewe're quite excited but could use your assistance in nudging this project forward.

Thank you,

"new evidence is a hoax

"""

No, Dolphin52, you have not provided any such """"numerous authoritative sources"""" for the definition. I understand why you feel that my request for documentation """"doesn't make sense"""" to you. The request needs to be understood in the context of (A) Wikipedia policies and guidelines, and (B) rules of legal analysis. What you have done is provide numerous quotations  taken out of context  from various court cases and from other sources. Many of the court cases did not even involve federal taxes.

Further, assuming you are still defending the verbiage that was removed from the article, you appear to be arguing that an """"excise""""  in the U.S. constitutional law sense  is limited to a tax on privileges, etc. That argument is completely invalid.

There are two problems with the argument. First, none of the sources you provided say that all excises (in the constitutional sense) must always involve a tax on a """"privilege,"""" and none of the sources you provided stand for that proposition. Second, by contrast, I have specific federal court cases where the courts ruled various events or activities to be taxable events  yet those activities or events do not involve any """"privilege.""""

Later, I'll repost, on this talk page, the actual text that was removed from the article, and I will again summarize  applying Wikipedia policies and guidelines and rules of legal analysis  why the removed material was objectionable. The analysis you provided violates various Wikipedia rules, and it also violates some of the basic tenets of legal analysis.

Now, for some more background.

The argument that an excise (in the constitutional sense), must always involve a """"privilege"""" to be valid is called a """"tax protester argument."""" It is not only legally invalid, but it is worse: it is also legally frivolous. A person can be penalized monetarily for even raising such an argument on a federal tax return or in a federal court. Later, I'll also post examples of actual court cases where people specifically argued, using the """"privilege"""" argument, that their income could not be taxed under the federal income tax laws, and their arguments were ruled invalid.

On a separate note, it should be obvious that the argument that a excise (again, in the constitutional sense, not the statutory sense) must always involve a """"privilege""""  is legally nonsensical for an entirely separate reason: Engaging in criminal activity is not a """"privilege"""" in any correct legal sense. Yet, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the federal income tax (which is an excise) may validly tax the receipt of funds in a criminal activity (specific examples: funds received by extortion or embezzlement), even though the wrongdoer is required to return the funds to their rightful owner. And the federal courts have repeatedly and overwhelmingly ruled that the federal income tax is fundamentally an excise, not a direct tax. (I know of only a couple of cases off the top of my head where a federal court actually ruled a particular federal income tax to be a """"direct tax,"""" and one of those cases was later overruled). On this basis alone, an """"excise"""" cannot possibly be limited to ONLY a tax on a privilege, etc.

Stay tuned.   """,0,0,0

Please replace the last paragraph about the hauntings with the following:

Several stories are in circulation as to the haunted nature of the castle:
 the first legend concerns a female ghost said to look out from the castle windows; she is purported to be the daughter of a former owner of the castle, a certain Dean Swift, who, unhappy with his daughter's choice of lover, had her locked away in a tower, where she either starved to death, or was put to death by her father, depending on the version; 
 the second ghost apparently makes a yearly apparition on the 29th November, and is supposedly a guard who fell asleep on duty and was thrown to his death from the ramparts of the castle in punishment. His footsteps can be heard as he wanders the castle to make amends for his carelessness;
 the third legend concerns another female ghost, this time a woman who wanders the castle, spreading the scent of wild flowers, or lilacs, wherever she goes.

Primary meaning

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

 Template:Infobox WRC driver/sandbox 

dHi Pelmeen. I saw your message at WT:RALLY regarding an updated version of the WRC driver infobox template. I've taken a look and I have some suggestions:
 Instead of calling it """"Infobox WRC driver"""", we should call it """"Infobox Rally driver"""". Although not often, we are beginning to cover drivers from IRC, ERC and other notable rally drivers who aren't WRC drivers.
 There shouldn't be a reason for both of the name= and fullname= fields, one should suffice (This is a fault with the current template, also)
 Instead of calling the next section of the infobox """"World Rally Championship record"""", there should be an additional field that the editor can choose options of WRC, IRC, ERC, etc etc so that we can use this infobox on other rally drivers
 The co-driver= field should be made clear in the """"doc"""" page that this shouldn't be used just for the current co-driver, especially if the drivers' previous co-drivers are notable and have Wikipedia articles
 Same for teams=
 The races= field, which is generated in the Rallies line of the infobox  it's unclear what this is for perhaps change it to races-number= or even better, add an additional field rallies-number=, tell users in the doc that """"races"""" is depreciated and """"rallies"""" is preferred (because the output is """"Rallies"""")
 I'm not sure that the points= field is necessary. What importance is is that Sebastien Loeb, for example, has won 1133 in his career? We only care about the current season. There is no championship for total points, and because the length of each drivers' career is different, it's not really comparable between different drivers
 I'm interested in seeing the medaltemplates= field in use. What is this for?
Hope these comments help, I'll watch the sandbox with interest for additional updates.    Chat   """,0,0,0

"You can't have a citation that something does not exist unless that citation contains proof that the construction is impossible.  That the citation author is unaware of the existence of something is not proof that it does not exist.  I am unaware of the existence of cylindrical celled zinc-carbon batteries, but I would never make the claim that they don't exist

In this case, the author of your reference is wrong.  The centre battery in the illustration to the right is of a flat celled alkaline battery.  Zinc-carbon (and indeed zinc-chloride) batteries are made using layer cells wrapped in a wax type coating, or even these days heat shrink plastic, for that is all that is required.  Alkaline cells generate gas during discharge, which is absorbed by the chemistry, though there is a delay.  As a result, some pressure does build up which requires a more substantial container.  In virtually all alkaline constructions, that container is made from steel.  Even a quick look at the centre battery shows rectangular cells made with steel containers.  No manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries is going to go to that unnecessary expense. 

I have therefore reverted your edit.  If you wish to continue to insist that there are no rectangular celled alkaline batteries, then please provide a citation that the construction is impossible. 212.183.140.5  

Leclanché cells

To describe dry celled zinc-carbon as 'Leclanché' is completely incorrect.  Georges Leclanché did not invent, build, or even conceive of a dry version of his famous cell.  Indeed, the chemistry isn't even the same.  The electrolyte in the Leclanché cell is ammonium chloride.  The (paste) electrolyte in the dry zinc-carbon battery is a 50:50 mix of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride.  The difference gives the dry battery an e.m.f. of a little over 1.5 volts versus the Leclanché 1.4 volts.  Later, so called, high power versions of the cell dispensed with the ammonium chloride completely and just used zinc chloride.

In any case, the most common name for this type of cell is the zinc-carbon and that should therefore be what it is refered to in the article.  Few people (if anyone at all) call it anything other than a zinc-carbon.  I also cannot find any manufacturer who describes it as 'Leclanché'.  I have therefore reverted this as well. 212.183.140.5",0,0,0

Could another admin have a serious word in the ear of StuRat (talk • contribs). He is a consistently disruptive editor who regularly accuses admins of abuse and cabalism. This evening alone he has been:

Accusing an admin of """"an abuse of Admin authority"""" in protecting a page being targeted by a persistent banned user (whom, incidently, StuRat was an erstwhile colleague of and still occasionally adds content on his behalf). 

Goading an editor who indicated they are leaving the project (after a run in with a new editor with a suspiciously detailed knowledge of the project) 

Replacing the goading comment after three independent editors expressed disaproval (the aforementioned new user gets in on the act too). 

I have already warned him, but he ignored me, and I am a bit too close to take any action without stoking the claims of abuse. Thanks. Rockpocket 

1) Note that RP did not request a block, is it normal to take a request to talk with an editor and ignore that and issue a block instead ?  

2) I do believe that it is inappropriate for an Admin involved in an edit war on a page to protect that page when it has the version they support, and believe the talk page for that page, in this case Wikipedia_talk:Reference_desk/guidelines, was the appropriate place to bring up that concern.  

3) As I stated on RP's talk page, I was not """"goading"""" an editor who said they were leaving Wikipedia, but merely stated that I believed they would be back, and why I thought so.  I did object to the removal of that statement from User:Clio the Muse's talk page, by anyone other than Clio.  However, once Clio removed the statement herself, I respected that, and had already told RP that I would respect that.  Somebody else then put it back in (possibly a banned user) and I suspect that RP mistakenly thought it was me putting it back in, due to this edit comment: . 

Does this have anything to do with User:Light current? —Kyриx

Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media (in my opinion, Zionist-controlled Western media) suddenly blew it way out of proportion, for obvious reasons.  The history of this article clearly shows that it has been obssessively manipulated by a disproportionate number of Zionists (their edit history shows they are Zionists).  Anonymous Iranian who used to oppose the Islamic regime in Iran but is now 100% supportive of them.

    I must also agree that the behavior of this user concerns me. They have been very aggressive and almost disruptive when relating to bots and bot policy, the user in question is also threatening to go to arbcom over comments that I made regarding the fact that they needed to read specific information. they claimed that I had said that they could not read, making my informative comment into a personal attack. This behavior is on going and log term. I suggest something be done in order to address the issue now, before it has a chance to get out of hand and become a larger issue in the future. βcommand

    I would concur in the conclusion that IP69.226.103.13 is not her with forthright purposes, having seen his behavior at WT:BRFA and WP:BN. Given that he is opposed to discussing his behavior, any objections to an indef block? MBisanz talk

About GUSAC
by G U S A C - Gitam University Science and Activity Centre on Tuesday, August 16, 2011 at 2:54pm ·
GITAM University Science and Activity Center
 
The GUSAC team is privileged to invite the students across the GITAM University.
After several untiring efforts we have been finally successful in launching a
Science and Activity Center at GITAM University.
 
 
MOTTO: 
 
 “ It’s not what you know, It’s what you do with what you know” .
 
     Our main objective is to integrate knowledge and transfer the same to students.GUSAC will provide an exclusive platform to the """"Budding Future"""" by nourishing their creativity. It will unleash the genius with in them and capacitate them to implement their ideas to the in numerous problems arising in the world.
 
     A fresher aims to attain his/her goals during his/her tenure in the university. GUSAC provides a scope for students like these by imparting knowledge through classes,friendly seminars, practical assignments....., it also enables them to build a team for participating in fests  and assists them with the required infrastructure to make their projects, besides creating a platform for the student research.
 
Benefits of GUSAC:
 
It creates an environment for interested students to evenly space out and implement their ideas.
Many students who have potential and are interested in participating in various events fail to do the same may be due to lack of proper inter-departmental knowledge and freedom to put forth their ideas. This center fill these gaps and provide better prospects for the students of GU.
Students will be exposed to national level competitions and are provided with a platform to put forth their projects and to gain recognition for their work.
Most of the projects aimed at will be targeted towards nation-building, to help the needy and the disabled.
Seeing the benefits of GUSAC, here is a tentative curriculum on how GUSAC moves forward:
 
GUSAC will  be administered in the following manner:
 
Step 1: All the students are free to enroll into GUSAC by giving names into database and will be accessible to weekend classes, friendly seminars and practical assignments.
Step 2: The students who are regular to the weekly classes with their active involvement towards GUSAC will be shifted to this step based on a small essay or a video on """"why should they be selected into step-2"""". In step 2 the student is free to access the GUSAC labs and to use the equipments as well.
Step 3: Eligible students of second year (sophomores) will be placed in a semi-core group and will contribute to the decision making process of GUSAC.
Step 4: Eligible students of third year (juniors) will be placed in sub-core and will have higher powers than semi-core.
Step 5: Eligible students of final year (seniors) will be in the core group. They will co-ordinate all the events of GUSAC and will play a crucial role in the decision making process of GUSAC.
 
The students will be given weekly assignments which will make them think out of the box and students who win will be awarded in an interesting way. The freshers can gain extra knowledge and make use of this to innovate projects using their time productively.
 
 
Stepping Stones to Success:
A student gathering will take place every week to discuss their interests and recent trends in Management, Science and Technology.
Students will work on their projects and ideas with freedom and utilities.
Experienced students will give lectures and problem statements will be given to students as practical assignments to keep enhancing their engineering skills.
Events like expos, seminars, fests and workshops will be conducted on a regular basis and representatives from the industry as well as academic circles  like IIT’s  will be invited to these events.
Faculty members who are interested in sharing their knowledge will always be welcome to do so in any of the aforementioned events and gatherings.
Students will be informed about the fests, events, industrial visits, internships to retain the practical approach of curriculum.
The center will be visiting schools nearby to have  chalk talks with the kids and also will give them a privilege to showcase their ideas. The interested one's will be called upon to the university to have a look at our projects and ideas.
 
If the chords of ingenuity have struck right, why not unearth the Einstein with in you???
 
@ GITAM STUDENTS  why late, get yourself enrolled in GUSAC and  scale heights in the world of emerging trends.""",0,0,0

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,0,1,1

 How to insert new data into a sortable table 

Sorting makes the lists more useful, but more marginally more difficult to add new data.  It's not difficult once you understand that sorting numerically isn't possible because of BC in some of the years and commas in the casualty figures.  All we are doing here is converting those numbers into an alphabetic format that the table can sort.

Sorting for casualties, zero padding is necessary if we are going to use comma separators
CCCC represents the casualty number
Use:{{formatnum:{{padleft:CCCC|7|0}}}} 
Example: {{formatnum:{{padleft:300000|7|0}}}} produces 0,300,000
In case of a range, like (5,000-10,000), only the first number needs to use the formatnum template to make it sortable.
The use of the tilde '~' destroys the sort order.  I don't think it's really necessary since almost all of these numbers are approximate anyway.

To make years sortable we have to insert invisible characters before the actual values.
To do this, we use  anything here is invisible
 YYYY represents the year
For years BC:
Use: !{{#expr: 9999 - YYYY}} YYYY BC
Example: 846 BC becomes !{{#expr: 9999 - 846}} 846 BC
Note the space just before the . It is necessary!
For years AD:
We pad left N number of zeros to make the year 4 digits
Use: #NYYYY
Example: 3 becomes #0003
Example: 34 becomes #0034
Example: 345 becomes #0345
Example: 1456 becomes #1456
Note there is no space before and after the . Also necessary!

It looks more complex than it really is, trust me ;)""",0,0,0

 Rank Uiller article 

Hi Excirial.
First, I want to say thank you, for your time. And Happy New Year! I've made some changes on my article and I want to know if they meet the guidelines regarding Reliable Sources.
Kind regards, Zoe.
  

 Hello there Zoepe,

 I might be wrong, but at first glance it would appear that the references used are the names of several expositions that art was showcased on? I fear that this doesn't fall under reliable sourcing as these references cannot be looked up by anyone (While being also of temporal nature). Since the article is a so-called BLP page, a Biography of a Living Person the requirement for sources is several notches higher than it would be for other article's to be accepted.

 What you are looking for are sources such as newspapers that can confirm what is written in the article itself. There might also be coverage in other literature such as magazines that can qualify as reliable.  (Contact me,Contribs) """,0,0,0

 Issue on images still unresolved 

Slim, I'm copying this message and my reply to your page for your notice.

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I'm afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.

 Re 

So the same goes for the person I insulted?

Let me help you to be just for one day unbiased:

 It is true that there are """"fringe"""" elements that do not believe in evolution.
 However, someone who did not believe in evolution would have a very difficult time getting into graduate school in biology in any respectable accredited school anyplace in the world.
 Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs...
 The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt.
 ...and nonbelievers in evolution
 Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals?
 Why would you think otherwise?
 Among those with advanced training, I would expect this number to be far higher.

I am not going to carry on with this list. If this is the way to go about and insult/attack people in this ambiguous, indirect manner, I'd be glad to change to that way. It would be fun to attack people personally by implying things between the lines, like your buddy did (which you didn't warn). I am a very uncivil and aggressive person, so it would be fun to find alternative ways to personally attack those who do not directly insult me or my culture. Actually, I don't give a crap what you people at Wikipedia think.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

"removing edits concerning air crash investigations and qualifying them as third class spam 

Someone (AndyTheGrump) is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am an aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol-Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I am a registered transport consultant at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free.

 Genre changes 

Hi, as you can imagine many people have very different opinions as to exactly what genre their favorite (or least favorite) band belongs in.  The editing and re-editing of genres is a never ending cycle on many Wikipedia pages.  If you believe that the genre is not properly assigned to a band, you may want to bring it up on an article's talk page and try to reach a consensus decision, you may find that the discussion has already begun.  At the bare minumum you should use references to back up your change.  You don't want to be known as a genre troll! If you have any questions please feel free to drop me a line on my talk page.

Re: the """"rushing"""" comment ODF:

Personally I think the entire discussion of formulas is out of place in the Standardization section.  See the entry on Microsoft Office Open XML for an example of what is a better writeup, IMHO.  Keep the Standardization section to the basics of what, when and where, the type of summary info that should be upfront and easily found in an encylopedia entry.  Put the debates or other side issues in their own section.

Also, a comment by a member of OASIS does not necessarily reflect OASIS policy or even the majority view of the ODF TC.  It is just one person's opinions at one point in time.  The use of the word """"rushed"""" needs to be subtantiated, otherwise it is merely opinion.  Since I can also point to opinions on the web that say that ODF was not rushed, I think we'll both need to acknowledge that this is a debatable point, and either both sides of the argument should be presented, or an unadorned statement of the facts presented.

If we want to state the facts, we could mentioned when the ODF specification started standardization (December 2002), when comments on the lack of spreadsheet formulas were brought up (February 2005) and when the OASIS standard was issued (May 2005).  Was this a sign of rushing?  Or was it merely the case that it was too late in the ODF 1.0 process to take on this additional work?  It is certainly possible for the later to be true without the former.  2+ years for a standard is not typically evidence of rushing.

In any case, my vote would be to move this item to its own section, or perhaps to Standard office document formats debate.

 Daniel, your encyclopedia is a joke, and the article about Sanchez is a great illustration of the many and sundry reasons it is a joke. Every single one of your """"pillars"""" and """"policies"""" has been violated in the article itself, the discussion thread, and the administration of it. You and your cabal have allowed the subject to edit his own article; you've blocked verified facts from the article; you've demonstrated a lack of neutrality and good faith throughout; you've abandoned any pretense of common sense or even-handedness.

 The result is an article that is just plain false. But, you see, this doesn't matter at Wikipedia, because at Wikipedia all truth is negotiable, when means it is politically determined. The good thing is that, aside from anything that happens at the Sanchez whitewash page, the world at large is onto you and your crew. Wikipedia's lack of respect for truth, and its wholly capricious and abitrary administration, not to mention the falsification of biographies by its insiders and the insertion of corporate propaganda into articles, has been discovered.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied without attribution. If you want to copy from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

 Understanding how to write Wikipedia articles 

You are obviously a single-purpose account, contributing only to Ashwant Dwivedi. The chances are high that either you are that person, you are related to him or you know him personally. In any event, you are pretty consistently making a mess of things at the article and I'm struggling to clean up the problems that you create. It's not a vendetta against you as a person, though.

There is little doubt in my mind that you would benefit from contributing to a wider range of articles in order to gain exposure to how we actually write things here. There is, for example, no rationale for including every news story that you can find about a person - especially not when they are trivial soundbites or repetitive information - nor is there any need to misrepresent sources by saying he is a """"Pacific Islands Diplomat"""" when, at best, he was a Fijian one. Things like this would be more obvious to you if you were not so constrained by your self-imposed concentration on one article. They would also be more obvious if you actually tried discussing things with other people and listening to what they say. I'm not always right but I am pretty experienced here and, as with anything in life, one key way to learn is to pick up things from those who have done it before.

I'm absolutely fed up with you at the moment, having given you a massive amount of rope over many months. But I'm quite happy to let bygones by bygones if only you can actually demonstrate a willingness to develop your skills here. The article will, in my opinion, be deleted anyway but there is much else here that you could work on in the future if you are prepared to spend a bit of time understanding how Wikipedia works. I rather suspect that we could use more decent contributors for Fiji-related subjects, for example. -   """,0,0,0

Zhongnanhai / """"China White House""""
The location of the headquarters offices of the Communist Party is to the West of the Southwest corner of the forbidden city. Here is that info from Google.com 

Zhongnanhai 
The Zhongnanhai is a complex of buildings in Beijing, China adjacent to the Forbidden City which serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China. The term Zhongnanhai is synonymous with the leadership and government administration of the nation, and is often used as a metonym for the Chinese leadership at large (in the same sense that the term White House frequently refers to the President of the United States and his associates). Chinese Presidents, including Hu Jintao, and other top PRC leadership figures carry out many of their day-to-day administrative activities inside the compound, such as meetings with foreign dignitaries. However, the complex is shrouded in some mystery as it is closed to the general public, with photography additionally being strictly curtailed at several prominent locations such as the main gate. However, China Central Television frequently shows footage of meetings inside the compound, but limits its coverage largely to views of the interior of buildings.

Nordic cinema
HI. These are exciting times are they not? What I had in mind two years ago on here seems to be gradually taking shape. The project is better and more organised than ever. I;m particularly pleased with the Nordic task force and the devleopment of articles such as A Victim of the Mormons. Who;d have ever though in the olden days we would have a half decent article on a] a 1911 film and b] a silent danish movie. If we can add such content en masse which are of s similar standard this project will devleop massively. Some day we'll have every notable film from every country, and up to a half decent standard (hopefully). I;m keen to encourage editors to edit Latin American film although this seems to be a sadly neglected part of films on here. I;ve proposed a new project but I doubt I'll get anybody to follow it as most interested editors are likely to be working on spanish wikipedia aside from the one or two film buffs we have on here. Anyway just to tell you I proposed and with Her Peghsip got Category:Danish film stubs up and running. I;ve also proposed Iceland, Norwegian and Czech film stubs if you would kindly chip in at the stub sorting proposals as well as a proposed split of documentary film stubs as it concerns WP:Films. Hope you are well.  White cat  """,0,0,0

"It appears that Cailil is the only person taking issue with a comments and criticisms section. It is pretty much default procedure for editors to place a comments and criticisms section in articles, particularly regardind articles about corporations. I think Cailil's abuse of admin power is apparent in this case. The fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article. This here is exactly what is wrong with wikipedia. Admin abuse is about the only flaw in the open source concept and project that is wikipedia. More often admins are seen as using their powers to strike back for bruised egos, or protection of their NON-neutral point of view. Wikipedia is flat out an open source project, and while the Policies are generally adhered to, even Jimmy Wales has left stuff alone when the community demanded it, no matter if it adhered to the policies. The comments and criticisms section needs to be put back into this article, I would do it myself but I cannot find it in the history section. If someone finds it but is afraid to replace it due to Cailil's threats link it to me in my user talk page. If he wants to fight with someone I will fight him, and will gladly strike back by reporting him as abusing his admin powers.",0,0,0

"""I've heard it said that Charles Darwin did not want to publish his ideas because he felt it would hurt his wife, whom he loved.  She was not an evolutionist.

That could be part of the answer. At least, so much can be read in Darwin's original autobiography, which was first published in 1887, esp. in footnotes in the chapter about the development of his own religious convictions. Another reason (also clear from his ab) might be his frequent illnesses, and his zealous drive to publish as much as possible about other biological/zoological fields of research. He was always frustrated he could not do more.Fact is he produced an enormous amount of work!.
A third reason Darwin waited 19 years was that he simply was afraid of being 'prejudiced' (word quoted literally). His theory needed more time to ripen, so to speak. Anyway, maybe this is of some help. Anyone with more knowledge about it,please go ahead.

Imho the first sentence """"Contrary ..."""" should only appear later. One who does not know anything about Darwin reading this page should have a short introduction as first paragraph, not a negation of something assumed to """"be publicly known"""". (Yes, I am picky ;)

Framework is now in place for a good article, but a lot more work needs to be done. I'm going to get to this on and off over the next few weeks (hopefully), but anyonelse should feel free to wade in - however make sure your """"facts"""" come from works in the history of biology, not from popular works as these often make sweeping generalizations about Darwin.

Hi.  I was amused to see this added to the infobox on The Small Rain, published in 1945. Having collected L'Engle novels for over 30 years, I've still never even SEEN the original cover of this book - and if I did, I'd have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for Wikipedia. Rest assured that I will always post first edition covers if I have them, but it's not always possible. For example, my hardback of The Young Unicorns is an ex-library rebinding.  I've searched online for the cover of the first edition, and nobody has one posted.  All I see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art. No big deal at this end - I know you're just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible. Still, I'll be very surprised if we ever get 100% compliance on L'Engle books of the 1940s to 1960s. Regards, and keep up the good work!  | Talk | contribs """,0,0,0

Not among casual fans. Casual fans first think of the animated series, which focused on her flying and strength. Only the hardcore fans even knew about the absorption thing before the first film. Well, you have to admit, Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character are much easier to sell to audiences than any of the other characters are/were. That's why we got a Wolverine movie and not a Cyclops movie, or a Rogue movie, or a Storm movie...or anyone else for that matter. 

Yeah, according to McG, J. Nolan wrote like the entire third act and he was pissed that the WGA didn't give him writing credit for it. 

Well, as they appear in more episodes I was being forced to realize that they are not """"recurring guests"""". Since the companions are seeing fit to include some real world info on them it was either create 4 new sections and develop them in the style of Oliver Queen...or, create a new page for all of them to exist and trim Oliver's section down to something like Clark's section and then create sections for the others that mirror that setup as well. The thing with Martha and Jonathan is that they aren't going to get any bigger. We still have season 9 ahead of his, and potentially season 10, which means potentially more appearances from these members as well as new ones. The only problem I forsee is that they have not greenlit a season 8 companion yet, because sales on season 7 weren't that great. But, as far as these specific characters go I should be just fine. I have a whole section in season 6 companion on their costumes (which I can probably scan that image and overlay it with their traditional comic book representations for a new gallery image).

Come on guys. The section on Turkey is highly biased and provides more space to the justification of Pelosi's attitude to the proposed bill on the so-called Armenian Genocide and doesn't give the other side to provide any justification why the Prime minister of Tuyrkey has negative attidue on this bill. I think that for the neuturality of this article, the section on Turkey shall be extended and editors shall give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue.

Otherwise, this section seems like an election platform of ms. nancy prior to elections.

I have been trying to extend this section, but pro-Nancy editors and probably her office staff are deleting all my additions without any justification.

Biased section on Turkey

""""Turkey On October 11, 2007, regarding a proposed House resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi said that the measure would be brought to a vote because """"While that may have been a long time ago, genocide is taking place now in Darfur, it did within recent memory in Rwanda, so as long as there is genocide there is need to speak out against it..."""" [27] Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations. [28]"""""""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

Stop with the damn accusations of pro-nancy and elections. If you knew anything about American politics you would know how silly that sounds. You have been warned twice on your talk page to be civil and not use this talk page for a platform. You also have the ability to edit the page yourself, but I doubt you will be able to keep a neutral tone. Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. Turtlescrubber  

""""give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries. And surely this biographical article is not the right place for such an """"explanations of other side"""" (simple denial of the anti-human crime). Andranikpasha  
Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.

As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.

If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by 213.172.72.6 (talk) 

The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby. 
She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events. 

Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none.

 Origin 
Parts of this article particularly the """"Origin Section"""" not only failed to cite reliable sources, it also left out material facts as regards to the true origin of Takrur (also spelt Tekrur).  In this regard, it totally left out the history of the Serer people (also spelt """"Serere"""", """"Seereer"""", """"Sérère"""" and """"Sereer"""") who are not only the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia along with the Jola people (Source: Gambian Studies No. 17. People of The Gambia. I. The Wolof. By David P. Gamble & Linda K. Salmon with Alhaji Hassan Njie. San Francisco 1985.)  to which Takrur is part of, but the article gives the impression that Takrur was founded by the Fula people and/or only the Fula when both historical and archaeological sources contradicts that claim.  In fact, at the date and time of raising this article for discussion, no attempt was made by certain people to acknowledge the trutful history of the Serer people who resided at Takrur or Tekrur. Edits I had previously made were vandanlised by a certain person with false and ridiculous accusations. As such, I call all interested parties for an open discussion before I start making further edit on this article.  That aside, there is no mention of the Serer people in this article.  It is a fact that members of the Serer group have resided in Takrur for milleniums, ruled it, implanted their own royal dynasty as well as their ancient religion (The Serer Religion or """"Fat Rog"""").  

The following is a quote from Henry Gravrand, author of """"La Civilisation Sereer Pangool"""" who also authored """"La Civilisation Sereer Cossan"""":

""""Since the publication of """"Cossan"""" (history), I took as a starting point of the Sereer story in Tekrur over 2000 years ago, I noted an important discovery. In the middle of the Sahara, in the Tasili the rock carvings listed by Henri L'hote, appears the traces of the present """"Sereer Cossan"""" (Serer history) or their ancestors, a period dating back to the third or fourth millennium. This engraving represents the Sereer initiation Star (Serer Cosmology),  with two coiled snakes, symbols of the """"Pangool"""" (ancestral spirits also ancient Serer Saints in the Serer Religion)... The rock where the Star appears is the Sereer symbols of the Pangool which was probably a place of worship.""""  (Source: Henry Gravrand. La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool.  Published by Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal. 1990. Page 9. ISBN: 2-7236-1055-1.)

The history of the Serer people who resided at Tekrur, the influence of their culture, history, religion and tradition on the land should not and cannot be erased from history.  To quote Issa Laye Thiaw, author of """"La Femme Seereer"""":

""""If the term """"“religiosity"""" expresses the commitment or devotion to a particular religion, it also applies to the Serer who are jealously attached to their traditional values and show little interest in respect of religions from outside.
However, few people adhere to these religions and gradually move away from the religion of the land.   The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds. In this context, their Serer neighbours assigned names and adjectives to things they have invented from scratch, trying to prove their superiority and that of their religion (the Serer Religion)…. The Serers are so far, one of the few people of Senegal who are not yet fully converted to a modern foreign religion…. Obstinately attached to the religion of their ancestors, the Serers refused to change the social and religious life inherited from their ancestors, making every effort to prevent the penetration of foreign religions in their country.  Only recently were they superficially converted to Islam and Christianity.""""

Issa Laye Thiaw's remarks about Islam is absolutely relevant as far as this article is concerned. For a more detailed explanation of what Issa Laye Thiaw is referring to when he said """"The latter is the object of aggression and distortion on the part of some Muslims, to weaken the impact in people's minds"""" please refer to Maba Diakhou Bâ's discussion page.

"Results Summary/Elimination Chart Semi-final placements  

On the elimination chart, I have replaced the 'adv' with other things that make more sense. 'Adv' is very vague. From the chart, I can gather that the top 3 voted contestants advanced. That is however not the case in reality. The top 3 females may have more votes that the top male but still the highest voted male, female and the next highest vote getter advanced. I have put a footnote at the bottom of the chart which says something along the lines of 'every week highest male, female and next highest advanced. Every week, 2 males advanced however it was never revealed which male was the highest and which male won the non-gender specific slot'... Because of this I have replaced 'adv' with 'Top 2' in the cyan colour for male contestants and 'Top' in pink for the female contestants that were non wild-card as we know that they were the highest female vote getters.

Eddie, the main problem with Wikipedia is that it benefits from the free time of many hundreds of thousands of individuals. So much spare time that it can treat them individually with contempt if it chooses, and get away with it, and not care very much, however much ill feeling that generates.
If it had to pay people for the time they input, it would use that time responsibly. But it doesn't have to pay for it. So it doesn't have to manage the resource responsibly.
Wikipedia cares very little how much effort any particular individual happens to put into any particular article. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, all of that effort can just be swept into the waste bin by someone else, the next person who happens to come along, if it suits that other person, and if that happens, it costs Wikipedia nothing, so why should Wikipedia give a damn really? It won't. Wikipedia can smile, shrug its collective shoulders, and say, """"The time you happened to waste isn't a cost to us so we really couldn't care less."""" 
The system lacks responsibility and wastes the time of countless individuals behind the scenes, and Wikipedia doesn't care about that. Why should it care, if it has millions of individuals as a free resource?
Once one understands the system, and one returns to articles and finds that one's contributions have been generally mucked about with to the point where there was very little point in contributing in the first place, and that the essence of Wikipedia is to waste people's spare time, and that people aren't being organised sensibly, the only intelligent thing to do is walk away and not bother contributing. What is the point in carefully drafting things, concentrating on getting everything right, if anybody else is just at liberty to come along and chuck the whole thing out if it suits them? It's a daft system. The system works because you have so many people contributing, but the amount of individual time that gets wasted, and the amount of irritation that gets generated in the process, is, I imagine, collosal.""",0,0,0

 Ayers 

He's never been convicted has he? X 
As far as I know, no.  Pretty sure of that.  Why?    
He's never been prosecuted, never been convicted. Calling him a terrorist is OR as well. X 
I mean, it's a BLP issue. There's no proof to it. X 
Where is he called a terrorist?  We just closed an WP:RFC with consensus against doing so, so that can pretty much be summarily reverted if it shows up.  There is some thought that his own statements about terrorism may be included with context as appropriate.    
He admited to setting bombs and being a member of a certified terrorist organization. Ayers is a terrorist.   
You certainly have a right to that opinion.  On Wikipedia we have agreed to not call him one.  Incidentaly, the Weathermen is not """"certified"""" as anything, nor does Ayers agree that he is a terrorist.  There is considerable reason why we don't do that here.  But that's moot.  That's gone up and down through all the available dispute resolution channels so for the moment that decision is final.    
You are wrong. I know it is hard to admit when one is wrong, but you should try. The Weatherman were declared a terrorist organization by the FBI - if that isn't a certified then I don't know what is. If someone belongs to a terrorist organization and sets bombs then they are a terrorist. I mean, you might as well argue that Paul McCartney isn't a singer unless he is declared as such.  
 You must have missed the dozens of reliable sources that Noroton posted at the RfC calling Ayers a terrorist.   
And you must have missed the point. According to the legal system, Ayers has never committed a violent act. X 
 Put down the keyboard.... you really need to find something else to do right now.    
Gentlemen, perhaps you can have a debate over whether Ayers is a terrorist or not on some other page - there are a million pages on Wikipedia, three million really, and I don't really feel like hosting a moot debate on the issue.  On Wikipedia we have decided to not apply that label to him.  There are probably a hundred thousand blog pages, message boards, etc., where you can call him a terrorist to your heart's content.    
Wow, you are a flaming liberal, aren't you?  So, let me get this straight...

In your opinion, someone who builds bombs for use against the U.S. Government and civilian buildings is not a terrorist.  Let us all hope you aren't in a position of leadership in real life.  Simply appalling, really. 75.40.204.26  
No! What don't you fucking get? Nobody is saying """"Ayers isn't a terrorist."""" Just that per Wikipedia policies, he should not and cannot be labeled as such in his biography. X

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's.

Crime
first of all you need to monitor that """"Lanicoya"""" that just because she is from Nicaragua tries to take advantage of that to try to keep sections from being created. managua is a dangerous city and wether she like it or not it needs a crime section like san jose costa rica has one and like san salvador el salvador has one. Nicaragua Managua is not a safe city okay i had copy the article word by word and it now has been chaged okay. here it is.

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua reported these incidents: 

Crime in Nicaragua is in high rise and the National Police does not have the resources to combat it. Crime in Managua has had a steady growth throughout the years. Managua the capital of Nicaragua is exceptionally extremely dangerous specially at night, street crime is very common. Majority of the violent crime that is on the rise is due to the countries extreme poverty and lack of jobs. The following incidents took place in March and April of this year 2007. 

Hotel Robberies 

On March 29, an American couple visited the city of Granada where they where robbed at gunpoint in their rental home. Several days before the couple was robbed they contacted the management about a missing light in the unit. At 11:30 a.m. on the day of the robbery, a Nicaraguan male in his late 20s (the suspect) was at the front gate of the property he said that he was there to fix the light. The victim walked the individual inside the home, where he inspected the light. The victim then walked the suspect outside so he could get his tools. As they got near the front door, the suspect stopped and pulled out what the victim described was a .25 caliber or similar to the type automatic pistol and demanded the American couple give him all their money. The suspect took the victim’s wallet, took all of the cash and then, at the victims request his wallet was returned holding only his identification, The suspect then departed the area on foot. 

On April 4, seventeen members of a U.S. missionary group were robbed at gunpoint while having dinner at their hotel in Managua. The U.S. missionary group was given housing at a locally-owned hotel located in a area not frequented by tourists. Four Nicaraguan males, including two armed with handguns, entered the dining room and took the group’s cell phones and all their money. Two of the suspects walked the members of the U.S missionary group to their hotel rooms where they stole their digital cameras, additional cash and iPods. The robbery lasted one hour, a hotel employee was able to get away and called the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP). The Nicaraguan National Police did not arrive, however, until after the suspects had left the scene. None of the victims were badly hurt. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy in Managua strongly recommends all visitors and tourists to Nicaragua utilize hotels and guest houses that have a front desk, security, or concierge that is staffed 24 hours a day; full-time uniformed security; access control precautions; a fenced perimeter and a well lit and patrolled parking area; and rooms equipped with safes for valuables and travel documents. 

Vehicular Break-Ins

In the early afternoon on April 21, a vehicle belonging to an American organization was broken into at a gas station in Managua. The vehicle had stopped at the gas station on Carretera Sur (South Highway), about two miles from the U.S. Embassy in Managua. When leaving the car to make purchases in the station store, a young Nicaraguan male approached the driver and said he’d watch the vehicle for money. The driver accepted this offer and the car’s passengers entered the gas station. When leaving the gas station, they found that the young Nicaraguan male who had offered to watch the car was already gone and they noticed that the rear passenger door window had been broken. A briefcase that held files and their identification documents where also taken from the rear seat. The young male who had offered to watch the car returned to the scene. The NNP took him in to further investigate the case but were unable to confirm his direct involvement in the crime. 

The Regional Security Office U.S. Embassy Managua recommends that travelers do not leave valuables where they can be seen in parked cars and, when possible, park in a location where the vehicle can be monitored or where they have cameras.

 Thank you for the assistance, really helps ) But in regards to the pages, you may be able to help me with a couple of questions. I know the songs by Kylie that I made have not charted, won an award, or have been covered by any artists as stated by WP:NSONGS, there are a selection of songs I found on Wikipedia by really famous artists that kinda sits on the same boat as these articles. For example, articles Superpower (song), Rocket (Beyoncé song) and Rocket (Beyoncé song) by American singer Beyonce are well cover just like my articles but have not charted, won an award or have been covered by a variety of artists as stated by the criteria (maybe the music video significance allows it on the site?), alongside Who Am I Living For? by American singer Katy Perry. Also, some articles have charted like Double Rainbow (song) and Choose Your Battles by Perry or Carmen (Lana Del Rey song) and Money Power Glory by American singer Lana Del Rey are only provided by some of the albums information, reviews and sources rather than independent sources about the song itself, etc. Some of the articles I made, like """"Too Far"""" and """"I Don't Need Anyone"""" feature info about being released promotionally through radio airplay and proposals of being an official single. Also, the WP:NSONGS does say that those three criterias do not have to been needed but are afromented to. I'm not trying to make excuses, that is not my intention, but maybe you can help me out on this factor so I can have a clearer idea and mind on what I can do and cannot do with song/album articles.

This article is indeed biased due to the use of adjectives projected upon the EDL. Within the wiki talk page there appears to be sufficient evidence that the characterization of the EDL has not been fact-based, but in some cases the opinion of opposition groups. This very argument is taking place on the talk page of the UAF where they have successfully garnered favorable edits to their own description with the omission of the term left-wing, yet the EDL ‘s group type currently stands as “far right-wing”.  Even when the nature of a topic is agreeably abhorrent, the moment one describes said topic with words such as atrocity or (insert)phobic, the subject has become tainted with opinion.  As the world descends upon Wikipedia to learn about these groups due to recent events; it is vital that factual information be provided. I’ve never heard of the EDL until a few days ago, yet someone like myself, untainted by prejudice; can see this article is biased at face-value. Lacking an omnipotent author, the introductory description of the EDL should largely come from how the EDL describes itself. Any evidence to the contrary should be cited properly where Wikipedia provides. I don’t see how journalistic opinionating and scholarly opinion is anything more than just opinion.67.168.126.47  17:57, 27",0,0,0

Then Bella Cohen writes in her article in NY Times that she spoke in English to the invalid, and she answered back in English. Olga said: """"My nieces knew no German"""". And we have copy of a post card written by Tatiana already in 1909 showing good knowledge of German. We have schoolbooks from Anastasia showing that she took serious lessons in German. Olga said, I knew I was looking at a stranger. But in Berlin, she said: """"I believe in my heart that she is Anastasia"""", something she also repeated to Bella Cohen. She said: """"We showed her photos, and she did not react."""" Bella Cohen writes about how AA recognized Shura in a photo where Shura's face was hidden by a bell. Olga """"left Berlin with all hope extinguished."""" The very same day she writes her mother's secretary saying: """"How shall I tell Mama, this will kill her."""" (""""Mama"""" would have been devastated by knowing her grandchild was alive, that would mean that the others had perished.)

Gilliard calls her """"La Grande Duchesse"""" in front of Dr. Rudnev, and afterwords said that the woman in Berlin had """"nothing in common with the Grand Duchess apart from the color of the eyes."""" And that is after his own wife has shown him the congenital bilateral hallux valgus, the scars on the shoulder and the finger. And according to Shura, she had the same hair color """"with the same wave"""". Clearly these two were lying, their own writings tell us that. , Olga wrote to the unknown woman after the visit: """"You are no longer alone, and we shall not abandon you."""" """"Longing to see you."""" """"I remember when we were together."""" Would she write this to a total stranger? Would she give her personal photo album to FS? I don't think so.

 If most Protestants were not 'informers' that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. However I think Sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word 'informer' in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral. 
She says """"common usage in Ireland [so] describes (then and now), local inhabitants who give information to the British."""" 
But Ireland then and now also includes the Protestant north whose Protestant inhabitants see themselves as British and would no more think of not 'informing' than would an American who spotted an Al Quaeda operative setting up an ambush in Chicago. And they would not be pleased to have the epithet 'informer' thrown at them. 
Irish Protestants in the south then, or the north now would never use the word 'informer' in this context and their view should not be disregarded in Wikipedia.

 Cultural depictions of Johannes Gutenberg 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.  Regards, ''' 

Clean-up and changes by Mukerjee Oct 18

A number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up on
Oct 18:

 The claims of printing in Korea and China, largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations
 The Biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up (but still needs work). 
 The contributions of Gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the Renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters, this was presented with documentation
 The possibility that East-West traffic over the two preceding centuries of the Mongol Empire may have led to some knowledge in Europe of movable type  was introduced 
 A number of sentences and structures (such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs) were copyedited ruthlessly, merged with other fragments, and cleaned up. 

User Dicklyon reverts with the comment: too much of a change to do without discussion. 
This is not a criteria in Wikipedia, where ruthless editing is consistently
encouraged. 

Please justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them by
putting in extensive work instead of just a revert. 

I am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better, and has 
far better referencing and citations than the present version.  Please give
your reasons here; please do not blindly revert; edit''' the text 
to merge the elements you don't agree with.   It does not make sense to keep
the older inferior version that people are working with still.   

Such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months, with no chance for incremental review and collaboration, is just too disruptive and disrespectful, in my opinion.  But I'll let someone else decide now whether to revert you again.  I recommend a revert, followed by you re-integrating changes piece by piece, with time between for reactions and negotiations.  

p.s. We don't need weasle words in the lead.  If it is verfiably true that """"Even within Europe, there are those who claim that Laurens Janszoon Coster of Holland may have used movable types earlier,"""" then you have to say WHO makes such a claim, and give a verifiable reference for it.  The things I have read about Coster did NOT say that anyone actually claims or believes that, only that it was a local legend for a while.  

I understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone.  But the so-called """"stable"""" version read rather poorly, and at least the English and the flow is a lot cleaner.  There were repeated references (e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in Biog; the A&E; award had two references, etc), there were poor constructs,
and of course, the referencing was admittedly poor.  So please try to look at the whole picture.  Wikipedia says it right up front - edit the page only if you don't mind others """"ruthlessly"""" editing your text. 
As for the weasel word issue, this is what the current version reads (pls see the Biography section) - these were edits that were made before your comment here:

His business partner was Johann Fust who was more of a banker than a printer, but a 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster around 1940 and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz",0,0,0

 This is the English version of Wikipedia! Adjust yourself to that fact or go somewhere else. 

Why are English speakers always barraged by racists trying to insist that we use their language? Especially Spanish and Arabic. This is the English version of Wikipedia, and it should be written in English. Why do these racists always try to cram Spanish down our throats? Everyone in the world has a language. Yours is not better than mine. In fact, it is inferior. Speak, read and write Spanish if you want. And use the Spanish-language version of Wikipedia. I don't care. But stop harassing me! This page is not nearly as bad as many others, but I am fed up with this practice. The leading paragraph of some topics is virtually unreadable because a translation has been added for almost every word.

In this article the leading paragraph provides the asinine translation found in this sentence: """"He is the founder of Ricky Martín Foundation (in Spanish Fundación Ricky Martin), a non-profit charity organization."""" To begin with, a moderately mentally-retarded person, who doesn't speak either language, could probably figure that out. There is no legitimate reason for this translation. And why the racial prejudice? Where is the Russian translation? What about German, Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, etc? The logical conclusion of this absurdity will be that every word of the English article will be followed by its Spanish counterpart. Insanity! We don't vandalize their wiki; they should stop vandalizing ours.

I checked the Spanish-language wiki for this article, and it contains no translation into English. That is appropriate. This version should contain no translations into Spanish, unless the Spanish wiki is shut down completely. Then it would be acceptable to include a few pertinent translations. However, this instance is completely pointless.

 Add-in of old material or add to new page 

This edit was definately a great improvement, the only thing is it stripped out some information that I think was good. How about we add some of it back in or add some of it to start a new artcile Goddard Space Flight Center Facilities or List of facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center or something like that. Comments? Here is the material that was taken out on that edit:

West Campus
The West Campus contains buildings that support administration, research, design and construction of spacecraft, operation of spacecraft, information storage and archival, and data analysis. The buildings generally are two to three stories high, often brick, and simply detailed. Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:
The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. 
The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. 
The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. 
The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. 
The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.
The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.
The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed """"The SES"""") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. 
The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. 
The Spacecraft Fabrication Facility where Goddard technicians and engineers manufacture components used for spacecraft assembly. This includes the tools which the astronauts use in space as well as the spacecraft themselves.
The Building 29 Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility is a 7990 m² facility that contains one of the largest cleanrooms in the world. The High Bay Cleanroom is a , class 1,000 (M4.5), horizontal flow cleanroom measuring 30.5 x 38 x 27 meters (100'x125'x89'). Its five {{con",0,0,0

 A tag has been placed on Argaman requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

My edit had 3 links in close proximity. I had left them in the infobox for consistency of style, i.e. dates in black, teams in blue. There was nothing overly offensive about it. The article itself had no such overlinking.
Your edit had a careless typo and some information removed. I saw it as careless, unnecessary and rude, and so I reverted you. You reverted me without correcting your mistakes, and so I simply reverted you again as you were being continually rude. 
I may have come across as confrontational, but your continual """"No, I am correct"""" revisions came across to me as confrontational. You started this. You are still being rude with your refusal to take any blame. As I read through your talk pages I see a lot of this arrogant """"I know best"""" behaviour. Sure you contribute a lot, and probably do know the correct style better than the average contributor, but can you not accept that your behaviour in this case was far from ideal? I can accept that mine was, but as I have pointed out a number of times already you started this and I felt the need to defend my position.

I'm Gonna Tell You Like This

Okay, I see you are one of the editers against having album covers on the artist's page because it's """"fair use"""".  Not having those covers on the artist's page iz an outrage.  For years wikipedia had the policy of having the wikitable with the album covers on them.  But then in 2007 some administrators (aka nerds with power on wikipedia/tyrants) decided that even though wikipedia will never be sued for this action, that they were gonna take all the album cover off the pages.  But a few bold editers such as my self, did not except nor like this change and continued to put the album cover on the page due to the fact that's where they belong.  I have been blocked 3 times for this and am sick of it.  I'm not saying all administrators are a bad, I have even read comments by some that said that they would rather have the covers included.  I also was visiting a admi. page and read """"Even the most anti-album cover administrater agrees that wikipedia will never be sued for the album covers.  You know what I'm sayin' Loc?  We want album covers, man.  Whether it be you, Steel, Spellcast, Mel Ethis, Shadyaftermathgunito or whoever keeps deleting the album covers, you guys got to stop.  Do you guys get paid for every album cover you remove?  That is the only reason I can think of for you guys being so anti-album cover.  Damn, we only live once.

Essex, Vermont as a City
Hi, thanks for your note. As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants """"city"""" status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city """"status"""" if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  

According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), """"The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ... It is the form of government, not population, which distinguishes Vermont cities from towns.""""  Thus, it seems that something in Vermont is a city if and only if it has a city charter.

Ultimately Ms. James steadfastly refuses to prove that she is a graduate from the University Of Chicago and if she makes up lies of that nature than what can be true about any thing else she claims to have achieved? Andrea James where is the proof, lets see your degree and tran Pityscripts from the University Of Chicago.

Furthermore Andrea loves to use her web-sites as a whipping post to harm professionals reputations who will not bow to her perverted view point. With out one doubt Ms. James needs help but like a pathological liars she will fix it her self and damn the people she hurts. In a way you have to feel sorry for her, however you cannot forgive her crimes against her sisters and the community she claims to represent when she thinks nothing about harming a hard working professionals reputation. In reality what that boils down to is jealousy of the worst nature and her use vile """"Yellow Journalism"""" and evil deeds would make any sociopath proud"""". Andrea James gets an A+ for being a sociopath.

The real tragedy about Andrea James is her failure to admit when she is wrong and to keep on making the same mistake in front of every one because she thinks it will go away. Your wrong Andrea if you want respect and people to like you, than you need to learn that hurting people reputation will not make you any friends.

The fruit page mentions plants only. However, there is another example of a fruit. 

When a fungus grows to the point that it can produce spores, the portion of the fungus that contains the spores, or fungus seeds, is considered the fruiting body of the fungus.

Currently, the fruit page only gives information about plants being fruits but even the fungus Wikipedia article states that the mushroom is the fruiting body of a fungus. I hope someone can confirm the validity of my claim.

I am coming late to this but I am unaware of any Muslim group that rejects Khadija as the first convert. The story of Muhammad's reception of the first revelation and his immediate flight in terror to hide weeping beneath Khadija's robe is a beloved tradition. While the authenticity of the many ahaadith is debated, this event is considered a crucial part of his revelation.

Preston searched for a name in a day, the name was suppose to be name after a japanese god of destruction but it may corrupt their religion of islam.

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian.

While the idea that the UK is the instigator of the war is delightfully odd, the OP does have a point - the article briefly alludes to the existence of earlier bombing (first para, """"Change of strategy"""") but never explicitly mentions it. However, the official history does explicitly connect the August raids to the start of the Blitz, even if they weren't the sole reason:

It would, of course, be too much to see in these raids on Berlin the whole cause of Hitler's next move; but they unquestionably added to his anger at the activities of Bomber Command. it would not be long now before D-day. What better policy, then, for this final phase, than to enjoy a swift and sweet revenge by hurling the Luftwaffe in force against London. For if the British capital could be reduced to chaos, the task of the invading armies would be enormously simplified (...) 'The British', he screeched, 'drop their bombs indiscriminately and without plan on civilian residential quarters and farms and villages. For three months I did not reply because I believed that they would stop, but in this Mr. Churchill saw a sign of our weakness. The British will know that we are now giving our answer night after night. We shall stop the handiwork of these night pilots.' Three days later, on 7th September, the Luftwaffe abandoned its offensive against the sector stations and began the assault on London. From the point of view of winning the battle, Dowding himself could not have made a more satisfactory decision. (pp. 182-183)

Space disposal
I've been on a rampage today, looking for stuff that needs to be completely redone. So I rewrote the section on space disposal. It no longer contains any speculation on the feasibility of space disposal using technology that hasn't been created yet. More importantly, it now refers to a reliable source. I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings but it really needed to go.   
Thanks. These are people who nearly had seizures when we launched Cassini at Saturn with a few kg of Pu-238 in it. Even if we had a magical propulsion system for launching actinides into space for free, I doubt that politically people would tolerate the booster failure risk rate. If 1% of these things are going to fail and go into the ocean, why not just include the other 99% as well, while we're at it? ;). At least if you pick your spot, you can drop casks into ocean crustal subduction zones (which has been suggested).  

 """"A number of incidents"""" 

""""A number of incidents have occurred when radioactive material was disposed of improperly, simply abandoned or even stolen from a waste store.""""

"Help requested to mediate deletion of article Maurizio Giuliano

Dear Chair,

The above article has been the subject of changes and disputes, and finally it has been deleted.  I was involved in editing the article, and I honestly can disclose the fact that I know the subject of the article.  But I honestly don't feel that I am biased in favour of the article - though as a lawyer, I trust you can better see whether I am indeed objective as I claim to be.

To the best of my perception, most if not all the changes, and the deletion itself, saw the involvement of a specific user, whom I shall not mention out of courtesy.  I was surprised by the objections and changes made by the user, but did not object, and instead worked with him to solve the issue and improve my own objectivity.  We had some useful correspondence and I felt the issue was being addressed informally.

PROBLEM: Now however, the article has been deleted.  And I can see on the deletion discussion, that there was no consensus at all.  One specific user pushed for the deletion, and a decision was taken to delete, despite many votes to keep.  The discussion seems to me very biased against the subject of the article, and I note the following:

 The objector stated that his status as Guinness record holder is not proven.  The subject IS in the Guinness Book of World Records, 2006 edition, page 126 on the UK edition.  I can send a copy of the scanned page by email or upload it as may be requested.  I think this already makes him notable.  (The objector pointed out that some online media cited him as being 23 when he broke the record.  He was instead 28, and this is reflected correctly in the Guinness Book and in other media.  Some media just got it wrong.  I don't see why this should be relevant).

 Regarding his books, the subject published two books.  The objector claimed that these are self-published sources.  That is true.  But there is also plenty of third-party materials about his books, which you can find online.  So, he published two books which have been reviewed by others - he is an author.  I think this is enough for inclusion.

 Finally, the strangest thing: the objector disputes his notability as a UN official !  The issue here is that his status as a UN official was not even mentioned in the article - certainly not until I last saw it !  So, why did this become a topic for discussion ?  This makes me almost suspect that there may be a 'personal' element.

 Regarding other articles where he is cited...  The same user has also deleted his name - among many - from the article on the Centre for Social Studies, where there was a sentence stating that the Centre's published authors included him.  How can this be disputed ?  There is a book with ISBN etc. available on Amazon, clearly indicating that he is the author and the Centre is the publisher.  This should be sufficient proof of the fact that he is one of the Centre's published authors.

I hope you can resolve the dispute, and my ideal solution would be:
- The article is reinstated, and you can make any changes to it you deem appropriate.
- If there is anything substantial I object to or if I want to add new info, I shall contact you (or someone you might designate) instead of making changes directly.
- The one user who keeps objecting to the article should be asked to refrain from making changes directly, and instead go via you (or someone you might designate).

Sample comment: This seems to be a fine summary statement, reliably sourced in the article such as by UPI. We can just copy the footnote refs to it.   
The popular usage of """"moneybomb"""" to describe a coordinated mass donation drive for a political candidate can be traced to a weekly donation drive, the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which aimed to raise $1 million each week for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.[2][citation needed] (Daily Paul)
Jesse Elder, a New York City jazz pianist,[3][4] registered the new identity """"RonPaulMoneyBomb"""" at YouTube;[5][citation needed] (New York Times, All About Jazz, YouTube)
Eric Nordstrom then registered the identical .com domain.[6][citation needed] (Network Solutions)
Supporters of Mike Huckabee organized a moneybomb on November 20 to commemorate International Children's Day, which raised nearly $225,000, well over the pledged amount, bringing Huckabee's monthly total to $1 million as of November 20th.[11][citation needed] (Nov20ForTheChildren)
Supporters of Dennis Kucinich's presidential campaign are also using the term """"moneybomb"""" to describe their own major fundraising drive aimed for December 15, 2007, the anniversary of the Bill of Rights coming into effect.[12][citation needed] (News and Policy)
Proposed on November 6 on Daily Kos, the drive has an ultimate goal for 100,000 pledges of $100.[13][citation needed] (December152007)
Kucinich supporters are using viral advertising techniques to promote the drive by putting up YouTube videos and circulating them throughout the web.[citation needed]
Along with generating a significant amount of donations for a political candidate, a moneybomb can also generate significant media interest in a largely unknown candidate.[citation needed]
In addition to the media coverage, the November 5 drive was able to get 21,000 new donors to the campaign, over half of the donors on that day.[18][citation needed] (AP)
While there is no definitive link, after November 5, Ron Paul saw a measurable rise in the polls, showing the potential ability for a moneybomb to improve a candidate's place in a political campaign.[20][21][citation needed] (TransWorldNews, NBC4)""",0,0,0

 All positive points, no negatives mentioned AT ALL... 

This article reads more like a propaganda page than impartial information. It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.

On April 29, as they were getting ready to launch the space shuttle Enedeavor, National Public Radio had a piece about the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer or AMS which was going to be carried into space by the shuttle. This instrument,   that cost to you and me and to all  taxpayers  2 Billions of dollars is supposed to look for antimatter created in the Big Band . This project was proposed by nobel Prize  physicist  Samuel Ting many years ago, it was controversial and several time Congress tried to cancel the program but could not overcome the lobbying by all the scientists  involved in the project. In the same piece NPR interviewed Professor Gregory Tarle , a physics professor who  said  'This project was a tremendous expenditure of money that was not justified....while the AMS was originally planned to search for primordial  antimatter, recent research show that that there is no way that it will find any"""".         
This physicist is from the University of   Michigan    and I am sure, people working with  Ting or other scientists  who were on the salary to built the machine , considered this man a kook, a subversive and tried to discredit him in any way. Do you think that if he now goes to the lab where the machine is built he is going  to get a job? Do you think that when you go to a professor who is the recipient of  a grant on a specfic subject and you tell  him that the subject he is studying has some alternatives and that he is basically studying an old theory and there are alternative ones, that professor will just tell you that you are great and that   you deserve a piece of the pie? Don't  you admit the possibility  that  he  is going to discredit you and send your work to a friend who is going to write a report....and do you think that that report is going to be  in support of the new alternative so his friend loses his grant? 
I am not sourcing this since it is a discussion on a different subject and it is very easy to find on the NPR site , however it is very pertinent to the discussion about Santilli saying that he was opposed....that is a normal event and if Santilli talked about this opposition is he  a kook and a fringe and should he  publicly disparaged???

Unofficial re-review by Sasata

At the request of the original nominator, I've having a look at the article again after changes have been made.
Referencing is now much better than before. I've condensed a couple of repeating citations.

I still believe the article needs to follow standard Wikiformat, including a lead, and division of text into sections, with appropriate headers. The argument that the article is not long enough to warrant separate sections highlights one of the article's deficiencies—it doesn't give sufficient coverage to the information out there. A search of the ISI Web of Knowledge Academic Database pulls up 76 research articles (dating from 1991-2009), but only a tiny fraction of these are cited in the article. Here are some research studies that I would expect to be cited in this article:
Thorson RM. (1993). """"Postglacial offset along the Seattle fault"""". Science 260(5109): 825–826.

Discusses data that confirms Holocene movement along the fault.
Karlin RE, Abella SEB. (1996). """"A history of Pacific Northwest earthquakes recorded in Holocene sediments from Lake Washington"""". Journal of Geophysical Research-Solid Earth 101(B3): 6137–6150.
Gives a geohistorical perspective on the fault and discussion of the secondary effects that may have been caused by the fault.
Dewberry SR, Crosson RS. (1996). """"The M(D) 5.0 earthquake of 29 January 1995 in the Puget lowland of western Washington: An event on the Seattle fault?"""" Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America 86(4): 1167–1172.
Analyses a 5.0 magnitude earthquake 25 km south of Seattle that is most certainly germaine to this article.
Thorson RM. (1996). """"Earthquake recurrence and glacial loading in western Washington"""". Geological Society of America Bulletin 108(9): 1182–1191.
Effects of glaciation/deglaciation on earthquake recurrence and its effects on current paleoseismic approaches to determine recurrence frequency.
I could go on (and on), but I think you get the point. There's a lot of research out there that hasn't been touched on in this article, and for that reason, it doesn't meet criteria 3(a) (""""it addresses the main aspects of the topic""""). I think if you were to address some of this research, the size of the article would swell up and section divisions would suggest themselves naturally. And with section headers and beefed-up text, image placement is much easier.

I'm not a fan of the outgoing links. For example, when I click on the outbound link (... local native legends) I expect to be led to a page which discusses specifically the a'yahos legend, but instead end up on a general site about Indian legends and earthquakes. Perhaps the a'yahos legend is somewhere in one of those links, but I shouldn't be expected to hunt around for it myself. If there is a specific page which discusses a'yahos, then link to it directly, and use a web citation template. If not, then this outbound link should be in the external links section (or perhaps left out completely). Similar arguments apply to the outbound link for Lidar-based mapping that appears later. I shouldn't have to go to an external site to find a definition that helps me understand the wiki article.

I hope this helps you on your quest to get this article to GA status. Good luck!   """,0,0,0

"Siege of Dubrovnik and other nonsense 

Take a look at this part: 

Đukanović's cabinet organized the Siege of Dubrovnik

how could possibly the Government of Montenegro organize a JNA operation?! Even in today's independent Montenegro, Government does not command the army, president does.

Then, there's:

 most infamous was the handover of 200 Moslem refugees in 1992 directly to the Trebinje corpus at the order of Milo Djukanovic. For 23 days the Montenegrin police and Yugoslav special forces under Milo's command hunted down the Muslims until each and every one of them was arrested. 

Make a search on the deportation of Muslims, and the command responsibility.

Milo opposed the Dayton Accords which he criticized as being anti-Serb

The moment that sparked most controversy in 1999 is when Milo as President openly asked President Clinton to bomb Montenegro

Against merge
The Uvs Nuur has already been confused by making the article about the lake instead of the basin. Much of the relevant information has been removed or confused in the merge or copy/paste or whatever an editor did. The hollow, although lumped in with the World Heritage site is really about a different set of issues including nomadic peoples, archeology sites, enormous variation in terrain, endangered animals etc. The current article on Uvs Nuur seems to have missed all the relevant points on the geological aspects, plus the name of the article is different from the name given on World Heritage Site. Further, the editors have disregarded that almost all citations are about the basin; there is hardly anything in the article about the lake. 

If you refuse to allow editors to write articles that they are interested in, and insist on an instant mindless merge, we can have an RFC, which I will abide by, unless you consent to a rewrite of the current article so it is accurate and not confusing. Why do you have such an investment in preventing other editors from writing articles about what they are interested in.

""":Other Wikipedia articles should not be used as sources, because this is circular. Granted, WP:CIRCULAR pertains to use of them as sources in other articles, but I think the principle is still somewhat applicable in discussion like this one. Simiarly other wikis should not be used, as per WP:USERG. It is better to use credible sources like Merriam Webster, which defines conspiracy theories as """"a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful conspirators"""". It does not include low credibility as a criterion. Neither does the Wikitionary entry contain third definition you attribute to it. 

It does contain a definition similar to the second one you list here, but if we assume as a given that that definition is correct, how does the Jesus myth idea not conform to it?   

Even if we did use other Wikipedia articles, the Wikipedia article on conspiracy theory does not mention that phrase or that criterion at all.

Frustration with repeated deletions and un-sourced additions by Jrkso

Jrkso,

I would like to think that you are editing in good faith - but you make it hard!  You seem to just pull ideas out of your head, delete well-sourced facts (repeatedly), and replace them with your personal concoctions - sources be damned.

Latest of many examples (for more, see Talk page, above):

You have now decided that the Taliban killed Sitara Achakzai, so you just plopped that into the article in the """"Government and Politics"""" section.  You provide no sources for this """"new discovery"""", no explanation.  You just went for it (adding bolded words, below): 

""""Women in public life in many parts of the country are subject to routine threats and intimidation, according to a December, 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Several high profile women have been assassinated, but their killers have not been brought to justice. When Sitara Achakzai, an outspoken and courageous human rights defender and politician, was murdered by the Taliban in April 2009, her death was seen as another warning to all women who are active in public life.""""

Do you honestly believe that you are contributing in a worthwhile way to Wikipedia with these methods?  Your seem to be intent not so much on re-writing the article, but on trying to re-write history itself.  No sources, no explanations, no sense.

And it gets worse.  On the edit page, where you again deleted facts, you seem to be explaining a deletion with this comment: 'Danieldis47, such a statement ... a """"transparent election is not possible."""" is POV ... how can that not be possible?)""""  

Man - It's a quote from the candidate himself!  It's HIS explanation for why he quit (not mine!)  That's why it is in quotes!  Would you delete an excerpt from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on Lincoln's page because it's his point of view (POV?)??

I am entirely frustrated here.

Sorry, your code is even unclearer than that in the article. Where did you pull the 18 from, for example? Non-experts of Python won't know that the return format of bin(a) will have a 0b prefix. Note that Python is used here as pseudocode, so it's better to avoid assuming much knowledge of the Python standard library.   

The Python code in the article suffers from two problems:
1) It's unclear what kind of value each variable holds. The variables should either be renamed to something self-descriptive, or a comment should explain the role of each.
2) The code is slightly obscure because it tries to be smart about not recomputing an index expression. Now to explain the algorithm, we don't need optimized code (and an optimizing compiler, which we'd use if efficiency is of any concern, would spot this anyway, so there isn't any reason to even slightly complicate the code even in production).

The code from the ACM Sian article by Chan is much clearer; here's transcribed and commented pseudocode:

def z_order(p, q, d):
    """"Returns true if p < q according to Z-order in d dimensions.
    p and q are supposed to be arrays of d coordinates.""""
    i = 0 # index of most significant dimension
    for j in range(1, d):
        # Use ^ (exclusive or) to eliminate equal bits.
        # msb_is_less will see ones where the coordinates differ.
        if msb_is_less (p[i]^q[i], p[j]^q[j]):
            i = j
    return p[i] < q[i]

def msb_is_less(l, r):
    """"Returns true if the Most Significant Bit of l is less than that of r.""""
    return l <= r or l < l^r # Described as """"neat trick"""" by Chan

Note that the algorithm in the article has """"l < r"""" instead of """"l <= r""""; this changes the result of msb_is_less but I suspect it does not change the result of z_order.

(It seemed that  and  are cruel Nazis, or facists, unfortunately.) 
 The third pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia is free content that anyone can edit, use, modify, and distribute"""". This means that Wikipedias are not even admins' private websites and that to revert other editors' distributions unreasonably is not helpful and not preferable at all. Please explain why you can have been doing the contrary.
 The forth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Editors should interact with each other in a respectful and civil manner"""". Please explain why you can have been doing the opposite.
 The fifth pillar of WP:5P says, """"Wikipedia does not have firm rules"""". Please explain why you can have been saying and doing the contrary.
 Please explain why you can ignore all of WP:5P?
 Please explain why you can delete the most important lead which explains from its original meanings. The important lead that you deleted unreasonably is below: """"Harmonic is originally an adjective relating to the combination of musical notes to create chords, later, becomes a noun meaning a soft high note played on a stringed instrument by not pressing the string all the way down"""". 
 Please explain why you can leave the unsourced OR sentence while unfairly accusing me of """"unsourced OR"""". The OR lead you have left is below: """"usually refers to the frequency components of a time-varying signa"""".  
 Please explain why you can express(lie) """"restore"""", though in fact you """"ruin""""ed the lead apparently. 
 Please explain why you didn't edit positively at all when you are not satisfied with others' edits. 
 Please explain why you cannot think your unreasonable deletings are obviously useless and harmful vandalism against other editors and readers.

 Light-emitting diode: the primary article, with references to other articles in the LED family; would include packaging and material from current Electrical polarity of LEDs
 Organic light-emitting diode: keep this separate since there seems to be a lot of good material here, although I haven't looked it over for redundancy
 LED circuit: the circuitry surrounding an LED (including material from LED power sources, Thermal management of high power LED, and LED as light sensor)
 LED physics: the internals of how LEDs function (including List of LED failure modes and Light extraction in LEDs)
 LED lighting: using LEDs to cast light on other objects (including material from Solid-state lighting and LED lamp)
 [LED stage lighting]] (keep as-is)
 LED beacon: using LEDs to call attention to an object (including material from LED anti-collision light, LED anchor light and Motorcycle LED Lighting)
 LED display: using LEDs to deliver information (e.g. status, images, video, text) (yes, there already is an LED display article, but it only covers video displays, which is overly specific given the broad title)
 LED art: self-explanatory (including material from Blinky (novelty) and LED Throwie)
 LED products: random LED-based products that I'm not sure fit elsewhere (e.g. LED Incapacitator, Individually Modulated LED, LED printer, DPL Therapy)

I'm least certain of the LED products page. I was thinking to gather together a set of LED-based products that (for the most part) don't really deserve their own articles. I'm no longer sure this is a useful path, though; perhaps these articles should just be improved in-place (or nominated for deletion). Thoughts?",0,0,0

 Yes, the above IP is AHLM. But I can say with a high level of accuracy that the other troll IPs/sock accounts are not. I would agree that AHLM is not the perfect example of a good editor and may have attitude issues. But that is something that could also improve over time. He needs to be instructed and guided firmly. There's a high possibility that his account is compromised and he's been shut out for the wrong reason (not that it excuses his other actions). I have been long enough on Wikipedia to see newby editors maturing over time and later becoming very constructive (and even an asset) to Wikipedia. That is why I would be willing to lend some good faith to AHLM. But before that, AHLM has to 1) sort out the behaviour issues; and 2) use the correct procedure and that is already specified. He also needs to sort out the security-related issues with his account and computer if someone else is messing around. '''''' (talk) """,0,0,0

"There are 3 articles.  Contract Bridge, Rubber bridge and Duplicate bridge.  It is possible there are more and that I've missed something.  One article is the parent article, it should include some history of how the game developed from Whist and that article would be Contract Bridge.  That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.  But I don't believe it would be appropriate to do more than touch on bidding systems.  Rubber bridge is the way Contract Bridge is scored.  Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.  But I would very much like to see these articles be friendly and readable so that a person who had never played bridge could read them and could find a logical development of complexity and of expertise required.  So that a green player could view both how to begin to learn to play and where the top is too, that people make their living at playing bridge, that there are international tournements of great interest, that some top bridge players are recognized by various public figures and so on.  So that a person can follow the logical development of being a beginning player, right through to becoming a top player.  And the joy of the intellectual compitition combied with the social intercourse of sitting at a table with 3 people.  We could compare that, perhaps, to Chess which is likewise an intellectual compitition but is less social with each board lasting longer and being less casual.  You know what I mean?

Request for Usurpation

Hello, Ryan Taylor. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because you have not used it to edit, and another user would like to use it to edit. Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given seven days notice to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to utilize the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request will be filled after seven days, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit. You may make an edit here saying """"No,"""" you may make an edit to blank this page, or any other edit you like; making any edit at all prevents your username from being usurped, because users with edits cannot have their usernames usurped.

Then, after struggling, Duffy came to the rescue, who asked his wife to send a box of pictures to Cantrell.

"Epalela fish pond 
 Epalela fish pond

A fish pond, or fishpond, is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish and is used in aquaculture for fish farming, or is used for recreational fishing or for ornamental purposes. In the medieval European era it was typical for monasteries and castles (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have a fish pond.

History

During the winter, supplying fresh food for a castle garrison was a constant struggle. Although meat would be available from deer parks, this couldn't supply the needs of the whole household. A fish pond provided an elegant solution. As long as there was a natural flow of water into the pond, fish required no feeding and were available all year round. There would usually be a series of ponds, with fish being moved between them as they grew.

 You are in violation of Wikipedia:Civility 

Since it has been months and you have refused to address it, I am soon going to take action through the appropriate channels in Wikipedia.  In Wikipedia:Civility it clearly states that you can't lie about users, such as outlined here (in regard to my arbitration committee ruling).  In the future, I suggest that if you make a ruling against someone, you don't simply make up dozens of claims against them out of thin air.

The problem is that when you make them up, instead of reading through what the person said to try to """"spin"""" what they've said, chances are you won't be able to find any supporting links as evidence.  This was evidence by one of your more bold claims of """"Cite your sources"""", where you provided zero (0) links as evidence.  The fact that you couldn't come up with anything upon request on the mailing list doesn't help your case either (you actually stopped replying completely once I very thoroughly outlined the many places I did cite sources).  This really is your last chance to dig and find something.

In case you're wondering, I was just kind of bored, which is why I didn't get around to this until now.  In retrospect, I find the myriad of accusations (lies) you put with zero (0) supporting links to be appalling.  If I remember correctly, you easily added over 75% of them personally.   """,0,0,0

Jevons indeed said that his work was not an extension of classical economics; it was Marshall who drew upon classical economics to explain the supply curve.  That's why I keep associating neoclassical economics with the latter rather than with the former. (One could labor the effect of Marshall upon Jevons, but that would be beside the point here.)
Whatever the intentions about POV when the original version of this article was written, it has got basic facts wrong.

In my opinion, nobody is going to be able to write more than a paragraph of a encyclopedic quality description of """"love hate relationships"""" because the term is so straight forward. Thus, much of the article is either going to be trivia (examples of Love Hate Relationships in books and movies), which wikipedia discourages, or made up explanations of love hate relationships (what the article is now). An exception would be if somebody found some academic research that explores the properties of love hate relationships. Then we might have something to base an article upon.

  Emphasis added, translations by google.
It's not clear to me how you get from that to your claim of """"ethics did indeed form the motive for criticism of Quinn"""".  The author of the article has gone well out of his way to state the exact opposite is the case.  (Just in case you're not familiar with the idiom, excuse in this context is the reason given to mask the real reason, which the author details in the preceding paragraph.)  I'm more disturbed by the fact that you think finding a single source is sufficient for getting a WP:FRINGE viewpoint into the article.  
You may be able to dig up a journalist who does think that ethical considerations motivated the behavior.  That shows you found a journalist who had an off day; it happens sometimes.  Given the amount of coverage we have to select from, I'd be expecting to see a half-dozen pieces expressing that viewpoint for it to be considered a legitimate minority view.  Despite lots of motivated, net-savvy folks looking for those pieces, they're still nowhere to be found.  This gives me high confidence that, for the population of adults who write for a living, the idea that ethics motivated GG is simply not worth writing about (probably because it's not remotely plausible, but I don't have to reach that conclusion here).

 Your edits to Washington, D.C. 

Hi. Thank you for the good faith improvements made to Washington, D.C.. However, the changes have been mostly reverted for the following reasons:
All new information must have sources that correspond with WP:CITE.
Per WP:SUMMARY, the main article on Washington, D.C. provides only a summary of information and does not go into very many specifics, unless it is considered to be a """"major"""" aspect of the city. Since hurricanes and noreasters are rare, they are only mentioned in passing. In our efforts to maintain Washington D.C.'s Featured Article status, the editors typically revert edits that would expand the information beyond what is required by WP:SUMMARY. Along these lines, storms that have hit D.C. are not mentioned because A) there is already a subpage on the subject (List of Maryland and Washington, D.C. hurricanes (1980–present)) and B) since we can't mention every storm, we mention none of them. It is also the reason """"noreasters"""" aren't defined in detail, because there is already an article devoted to them, which users can read to find more information.
The article is on Washington, D.C. itself, not the surrounding area. Therefore, any information about what happens in the suburbs or the nearby coastal areas is not included in this article.

"MUTUAL Intelligibility 

I've seen many people say that they can understand a different language on the discussion page and then list the languages as mutually intelligible. That is just one-sided intelligibility. Intelligibility differs from person to person and also depends on what is being said. For instance, if you're Russian you may understand a Polish guy completely, but your Russian friend may have no idea what's going on. And if the Polish guy says something else, you might not understand him at all. It is very hard to study intelligibility because there is so much variation. So just because you understand (or don't understand) something in a related language it does not mean that is the case for all speakers (or even most speakers) and it definitely does not guarantee it goes the other way around.
Mutual intelligibility is not one guy being able to understand something in another language. This is an example of mutual intelligibility:

A Polish guy is in the Czech Republic and asks a Czech guy for directions (in Polish). The Czech understands what he is saying and tells him where to go (in Czech). The Polish guy understands and finds where he needs to go.

If the Polish guy didn't understand then it is not mutual intelligibility. And this has to happen for a lot of people, not just those two guys. Alex",0,0,0

If you are familiar with MIS (the church's membership database), you'll notice that when they reach the age of eight they are removed from membership roles if they are not baptized within their eighth year. However, if their parents are still members, their names are kept in MIS (not as members, but part of a family who has a member) with the parents until they are 18. Non-Baptized spouses are also included. If I remember the designations for these are """"Child of Record,"""" (0-8) """"Unbaptized"""" (9-18) and """"Non-Member"""" (18+). They used to have an """"unaccountable"""" designation as well for those with disabilities who don't need to be baptized, although I've not seen it recently (no """"unaccountables"""" in my last ward that I'm aware of), and they'd also be included with """"Child of record"""" in my opinion.

 Items Not Yet Ready For Prime-Time Scholarly Review on Wikiversity 

As you may know, KillerChihuahau summarily baleeted these essays from the pages of Wikiversity, presumably because she disagrees with the notion of using the donor-funded site to educate 21st Century youth in modern concepts of ethical organizational management. Moulton 

 Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans As a Governance Tool 
The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.
The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.

The thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.

And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.

Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:
1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.
Evidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.

And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.

When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.

The irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.

The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.

The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.

So what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.

Or as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh!“

My view on this is probably similar (but probably not identical) to Cirt's. Speaking for myself, I have two problems with the use of """"Calvinist"""" on this basis: (i) there are multiple ways that calling a website 'The Calvinist Corner'  the most obvious is that Slick is writing from a Calvinist perspective. Another might be that he is writing about Calvinism. To take the former as true, and draw the the conclusion that Slick is a Calvinist is an inference and thus WP:Synthesis. It's most probably true, but not the sort of thing we're meant to be doing on Wikipedia. (ii) There's a fairly strong Calvinist thread through much (most?) of conservative evangelical Christianity. There are probably dozens of articles where we could find a similar level of evidence for applying the word 'Calvinist'. We don't, and to my mind shouldn't, unless a WP:SECONDARY source feels it sufficiently relevant/important a description to make use of it. This means that such articles aren't 'loaded up' with true-but-of-doubtful-relevance WP:IINFO descriptions. I suspect that part of the problem is that much of the secondary-source writing concentrates on CARM rather than Slick personally. However this simply means that, per WP:DUE, we should follow suit.

I've restored your reference but for now I've left in the """"dubious"""" tag.  On the subject of Aristotle's De Mundo, there are two points that should be made.  The first is that these texts are acknowledged to have not been written by Aristotle, but are often attributed to him.  The second is that translations are difficult and often there's a thin line between literal translations becoming unreadable to a modern reader, and interpretations that help with understanding the original texts.  There's many """"introductions"""" to Aristotle that make this point.  Aristotle in outline By Timothy A. Robinson or Aristotle By Christopher John Shields make similar points, as does A new Aristotle reader By Aristotle, J. L. Ackrill.  The Clarendon translations are often cited as being a set of references translations, translates the passage as """"In this sea are situated two very large islands, the so-called British Isles, Albion and lerne, which are greater than any which we have yet mentioned and lie beyond the land of the Celts"""".  Other translations are more literal - for example, early editions of Encyclopaedia Britannica state the following: """"The passage is in the De Mundo, c. 3,—"""" Beyond*the pillars of Hercules (Straits of Gibraltar) the ocean flows round the earth, and in it are two very large islands called British (BperaviKal Acyo/ievcu), Albion and Ierne, lying beyond the Keltoi.""""

There are political connotations to using the term British Isles when describing the Republic of Ireland, we find it offensive, the law provides for it to be called the British & Irish Isles in light of the establishment of our free State in 1921 and independence in 1948. So such political connotations exist in calling people of the U.S.A. """"Americans"""", the term exists because every other country in the Americas have their own identifiable description and you outlined some of those, this left the U.S.A. citizens to be dubbed """"Americans"""" and it is not politically offensive nor is it legally incorrect.

Now the last time I indulged in Mathematics, 800,000 did not strike me as half of 5million so come back to me when you have a little better grasp of the situation and stop making ignorant and idiotic comments on an issue that you have little or no real understanding of.

"Answer: You use the date July 20 of 1599 AD as Thot 1 and retreat one date back every 4 years, or 30 days back in 120 years. Example, 240 years is 60 days back to May 21 of 1839 AD, or Apr 21 of 1959 AD, then add 13 days in our 1900 or 2000 century to have Gregorian May 4 in 1959 AD. Another 44 years to 2003 AD and 11 leap days takes all the dates back to April 23. Then 2004-2007 is April 22. In reply to the post below which says the Coptic calendar is not Egyptian, the answer is our September 11 as Thot 1 is Julian August 29. Though the Coptic calendar (Egyptian with leap days) was accepted in 284 AD (which Era of Diocletion is the Era of Christian Martyrs so coincidentally the year 6000 of Adam in the Jewish book of Josephus published in Rome), this calendar leap day was created in 27 BC by Augustus Octavius Caesar who inaugurated it in 25 BC when Thoht 1 becomes August 29. Therefore, the Coptic calendar is Julian (not Gregorian). Events against America have been on Egyptian dates. The August 2 invasion of Kuwait is Julian July 20 and the invasion takes place at 30 degrees where the rise of Sothis occurs on that date only at that latitude; this implying Saddam chose the rise to invade. However, they felt world trade controlling oil was USA blame. Another date is Thoth 1 was Feb 26 in 747 BC. In 1993 the world trade was bombed on Gregorian Feb 26 not taking into account that Julian Feb 26 is March 11 (March 10 in leap year). The Coptic calendar honors this date as the half year placing Pamenot 1 on March 10 and the internet terrorists attempt to destroy world trade by constantly revising the March 10 virus.",0,0,0

"""Hi again. I do have this in the back of my mind and am aware of it. Apologies for being slow getting back to you.

It's a really hot day here in the UK after a series of hot days and my mind is not working clearly. I'm not sure what you're asking me. I think you're talking about Category:Beverage companies, and how breweries end up there. At some point that has been organised thus - Category:Beverage companies - Category:Alcoholic beverage companies - Category:Beer and breweries by region - Category:Beer and breweries in North America - Category:Beer and breweries in the United States - Category:Beer and breweries in Alabama. The brewing companies are contained within each """"Beer and breweries in Foo"""" cat. What you are proposing is the same thing as already exists, but separating the companies from the brands at a low level, and then having two cats - one of products and one of companies, running side by side up the tree. What I am saying is that is not needed and is unwanted. We'd like to keep the beer and the brewery together in the same multi-purpose cat. Beer and brewery are often related. Bass and Heneiken, for example, refer both to product and company. Where possible we deal with both product and company in the same article, though with notable examples we will split off the product into its own standalone article.

 A quick question on Aaron López 

I'm guessing that the nationality standard being used here is the same as the one I'm using on the all-time MLS club rosters: nationality by national team (including youth national teams), and in cases where there is no national team participation, nationality by birthplace.  Aaron López was born in Mexico, raised in the US, played ODP, but never made an appearance for a US youth national team...and thus counts as Mexican, correct?

 Roman Catholic Fanatics taking over christian articles in wikipedia? 

There has been a very alarming trend in wikipedia of recent. An organised gang of roman catholic extremists based in several western countries are editing and manipulating almost every article related to Christianity. Many of them build up credibility stealthily, gained administratorship in wikipedia and then started working on their agenda. The renaming of the article """"Roman Catholic Church"""" as the """"Catholic Church"""" is one example. All apostolic churches consider themselves the """"one holy catholic and apostolic church"""", not just the Roman.

Cuchullian is only part of a small group in this wider trend, he has been focusing on Romanising the articles related to Syriac Christianity in particular. The article related to Nestorian christians(Church of the East), Syriac Orthodox, Saint Thomas Christians of India etc have been attacked and manipulated. Assyrian Christians who were more or less Iconoclasts and abhorred themselves from extreme forms of marian devotion, are presented in these newly edited articles as adhering to the Roman Pope. How is it possible when Roman christians were at the opposite end of the theological spectrum?

The Catholic Encyclopaedia made in 1914, is at present a more sane and less virulent form of Vaticanised history than found in wikipedia. Wikipedia is becoming more pro-vatican and filled with roman propaganda, compared to the Catholic encyclopaedia! If we do not check this trend now, wikipedia will be transformed into a battleground of religious fanatics. People like cuchullian are destroying the ethic and defeating the purpose of wikipedia.

"Material from theraputic vaccines - too technical 

The following was added to the therapeutic vaccines section recently.  I am not sure whether it should just be removed, or if there is material here that once simplified might be useful to include.

HPV-associated neoplasia are being used to test antigen specific immunotherapies. Therapies have focused on HPV's susceptibility to immune manipulation. Imiquimod, a toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist, works as an inducer of natural immune responses and has been approved by the FDA as first-line therapy for external genital warts.  

  Focus has been put on testing T-cell responses to HPV E6 or E7 in intraepithelial lesions. Therapeutic HPV vaccines work to induce increased T-cell responses in humans. In clinical trials, these therapies were administered through different delivery systems such as fusion proteins used alone and with adjuvant, encapsulated polynucleotides, protein with adjuvant, recombinant viruses, DNA constructs, dendritic cells, and chimeric VLP constructs. While patients part of this clinical testing showed limited benefit from therapeutic induced T-cells responses, they were poor targets for antigen-specific therapies. The patients had late-stage disease, giving the tumors more time to develop mutations as well as deletions of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation.

The first paragraph has no obvious relation to vaccines, since it appears to be talking about other types of therapies.  If it relates to vaccines somehow, that needs to be clarified.  The other paragraph is too technical without enough explanation to make it comprehensible.

"From People Mag - 05-04-1992

INTRODUCING: URKSOME Steve Erkel lends his name
People, 05-04-1992

THERE IS STEVE URKEL, TV SITCOM character. Then there is Steve Erkel, TV scriptwriter and director of educational films and real-life person.
Steve Urkel, as played by 15-year-old Jaleel White on ABC's Family Matters, is America's best-known nerd, famous for his high-hitched pants, high-pitched voice and pig-snort laugh.
Steve Erkel, as played by 42-year-old Steve Erkel of Los Angeles, is a regular-looking guy whose life has been complicated by Urkel's success.
In fact, their homonymous relationship  no problem between consenting adults (or fictitious teenagers)  is no coincidence either. Steve Urkel is named after Steve Erkel, thanks to Michael Warren, the show's executive producer. Back in 1989, he borrowed his old friend's name  without telling him. At the time, Steve Urkel was supposed to be a one-episode character on a blind date with Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams). I had never known anyone named Erkel until I met Steve, says Warren. It's an odd name, but it sure clicked. So did Jaleel White's performance, and Steve Urkel became a show- stealing regular.
Then as the voice of the Urkel was heard in the land, Erkel began getting strange reactions. People started looking at me twice, he says. Over the phone, there would be these unusual delays during
transactions. Finally, in early 1990, a friend of mine called and said, 'There's this guy on TV with your name.' I watched and saw Michael's name on the credits, and I said, 'Ah- hah!' 
Erkel gets late-night phone calls from pajama-partying teenagers who scream, Steve, I love you!; his girlfriend, Susan Cook, a psychologist, sometimes introduces him as the other Steve Erkel; and even his parents, Lorraine and Roy Erkel, who live in Sacramento, find themselves having to explain the whole thing. And, says Erkel, I have a second cousin in Wisconsin named Steve Erkel; I hear that he's going through the same stuff.
As for Warren, he says he would never use a friend's name for a character again. Steve's experience has put an end to that, says Warren. From now on I will get my names out of the phone book.
Warren has invited Erkel to the set on several occasions and has introduced him to White. Steve Erkel says the first words out of Steve Urkel's mouth were: I'm sorry.

"""personal view of """"fire in the lake"""" is that it is a dated political tract written at a time (1972?) before many sources were available to write any kind of history. Especially any history about events in North Vietnam during the 1950s. The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that """"do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"""" I will answer """"YES""""! cos I dont want to lose my life!

 Sorry, I only meant to undo the edit where you added a link to Jurassic Park (since the article you linked to was regarding the Hollywood attraction, not Orlando). I have gone ahead and made the appropriate changes (talk) 

No problem. Thanks for responding.  (talk

 Boat Race reviews 

  The Running Man Barnstar Hey Dom497, just a quick barnstar to say thanks for the reviews of Boat Race articles you've conducted over the past year.  As of this morning, I completed my (initial) goal of ensuing that every Boat Race had, not only its own article, but one that was either of GA or FA status:  we now have 158 GAs and 3 FAs that we can all be proud of!  It doesn't stop here, for me at least, I'm going to keep up with improving the quality of the GAs and look for more FA opportunities.  Plus, there's the small matter of 70 Women's Boat Race articles to get up and running!  But thanks again, I couldn't have done it without your help.

Part II - Sources inside the New Testament
Now I am working on those sources that make up the Christian Canon. 

Gospel of Matthew
Here I am running into the same difficulty as I did at the Gospel of the Hebrews. I have now completed my review of WP policy on duplication. It appears to me that Ictu may be using duplication as a cover for POV pushing. Over the past several weeks he has visited many many many articles and removed all material from Edwards, Parker, Nicholson, Butz etc. 

However, there are some legitimate Duplication concerns.  The problem is that sources explain that during the formative years of Early Christianity 75 ancient witnesses testify to the fact that there was a Hebrew Gospel in circulation. Google Link Over 12 different witnesses testify that it was written by the Apostle Matthew. Google Link No ancient writer either Christian or Non-Christian challenges these two facts. Google Link 

Nicholson, Parker, Edwards, Bütz and others agree with Jerome. Thus the Hebrew Gospel is the basis for a number of topics. How do we go back to the fountainhead without duplicating material? The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Catholic Church and a number of scholars believe that Jerome was wrong and that the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible was written by Matthew.  As a sign of good faith I have removed most of the material objected to until we work out a solution.   

Comments
Two Ways
I offer a simple observation, born of my personal experience. There are TWO WAYS (see the Didache).  One path leads to assumptions of WP:AGF on the part of all editors and a focus on improving article content.  The other path, the dark path, leads to arbitration.  Once you start down the path of poisoning the well, you will end up drinking deeply from its water.  Hang in there.   
Thanks for the kind words. My problem is that although I have a strong grasp of the sources and references, I am truly dim witted when it comes Wiki-warring techniques. I need admin help to allow me to focus on the scholarship. -   

While we're talking generalities, my further observation is that I don't think you understood my """"blending"""" point about NPOV.  Trying to judge and weigh sources often leads to unintentional synthesis, which is forbidden.  Even experienced editors often do not understand this point, and attempt to suppress POVs that are, in their opinion, out of favour, to the detriment of the readers.  As I said, all significant views should be represented.  From your response I'm not clear that you understood that.  If you did, my apologies. I would hate to see you sanctioned in any way (and this is not a threat from me, BTW, but an observation about what others may do), but you need to familarise yourself more with the Wikipedia policies, or else you are likely to be be reported at ANI with undesirable consequences. It takes awhile to get into the Wiki-style. If another editor reprimands you, claiming that you are in breach of policy, it would be a good idea to presume that they are correct for the next 6 months or so. There is a lot more to policy than just avoiding content forks.  For instance, reacting to an edit war by reverting is not the answer, but would be judged as edit warring itself if you were reported.  And that's the sort",0,0,0

"""==GA Review==

:This review is transcluded from Talk:Seekers (novel series)/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review.

Reviewer: Hello, dear Derild! You might remember me from MOTD. This is a nice article, simply written, informative, and readable. ) I've done a quick see-through, though, and found a few okay, nitpicky, merciless person that I am, a bunch of concerns. Here they are!  talk 
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). I think """"...follows the adventures of..."""" might sound better.
 Dogs were considered but rejected because they were too close to cats in their hierarchal social organization, their pack and hunting lifestyles, and their territoriality. <""""their"""" is unnecessary in its second and third usage.
 The company wanted her to write another series on animals just not about cats. This sounds slightly awkward, maybe a comma or two will make it flow more smoothly.
 HarperCollins suggested dogs, but Holmes """"was reluctant...they guard their territories"""".. Direct quotes need direct references. The statement about HarperCollins suggesting dogs especially needs a reference because it's referred to in the introduction.
 """"the all-action excitement that the Erins love so much"""". Same here.
 the company then thought about horses knowing how Holmes also like them.. This sentence sounds a bit awkward, too (there's something grammatically incorrect in that sentence, methinks, but unfortunately, I'm too dumb to lay my finger on it myself).
 ...the main inspiration for the series is Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages The great grammar mystery..again.
 Lusa means black in Choctaw while Kallik means lightning or storm in Inuit.[2] Shouldn't Choctaw be linked to Choctaw language?
 However, even there, Ujurak, who leads the journey feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. I think a comma after """"journey"""" might make the prose smoother.
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). Here, a serial comma is used, while in other examples such as Lusa, Kallik and Toklo and The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky and Spirits in the Stars. the extra comma is omitted. Either can be used, but it has to be consistent throughout the article.
 The """"First Series"""" section could be expanded quite a lot, I think (especially since the books don't get articles of their own yet).
 Children's Literature picked up the environmental theme, it also commented themes such as """"commented on"""" is probably better.
 approach - three bears mdash;, mdash;, otherwise you crash..
 """"She also cleverly deals with the theme of racism through a unique and honest approach - three bears of different color, different backgrounds and different beliefs turn to each other for survival and friendship""""
 Kirkus Review  thought """"Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery""""; they also wrote that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot.[7] At first they're complimenting the book, and then they're """"also"""" criticizing it. Maybe something along the lines of ...mystery""""; however, they criticized the weakness of the plot and the excessive detail in character development and setting.
 """"Other media"""" could simply be """"External links"""", no? )
All in all, this article has a solid base and good references, but it needs much improvement to get there. I'm sure thattyping like crazy waay after midnight and getting up in the morning with bleary, bloodshot eyes some good effort will benefit it greatly, though. Keep up the good work!

"In reference to the formula 1-(-1) = 2 you posted on my talk page as being proof of addition by subtraction. Fine in theory (as I have yet to see -1 of anything), but I can prove that nothing is gained in your equation.  
Observe:

A=B.

Multiply both sides by A and you get:

A2=AB.

Add A2 to both sides to get:

A2+A2=A2+AB.

Using addition we get:

2A2=A2+AB.

Subtract 2AB from both sides:

2A2-2AB=A2+AB-2AB.

Thus:

2A2-2AB=A2-AB.

Combining terms on the LHS:

2(A2-AB)= A2-AB.

Divide both sides by  (A2-AB):

2(A2-AB)/(A2-AB)= (A2-AB)/(A2-AB).

Cancel out like terms and Viola!  We now see:

2 = 1.

So nothing is gained from addition by subtraction.

 Trinity 

Hi, Mark! I'm not committed to any particular wording. My concern is to find language that reflects the fact that there are more than a handful of exegetes that maintain that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the Scripture of the Old and New Testament. They would admit, of course, that the term """"Trinity"""" is not in the Bible and that the doctrinal formulas of later ages are not stated point blank. Yet they see the Scripture as a whole confessing one God, while confessing the Father as God, the Son as God under names such as """"The Angel of the Lord"""" and the """"Word of Yahweh"""" and the Holy Spirit as God. To me, """"some"""" gets to that. Without extensive research, however, I cannot say how many feel that way.

Firstly, I would really like to thank you for your kind response here! ) As for me calling Rlevse """"racist"""", that's what it looks like from the way he seems obsessed with keeping out any Lebanese claims. About edit warring: The edit warring article says this """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a discussion, or coerce a given stance on a page without regard to collaborative approaches"""" and also, """"Typically a user who edit wars is ignoring editorial norms, reverting rather than taking due consideration of the points made by others."""" But it also says: """"It states that a user who makes more than three revert actions (of any kind) on any one page within a 24 hour period, may be considered to be edit warring, and blocked appropriately, usually for a 24 hour period for a first incident"""".
Now there was no edit war going on, on the article in question.

As you can see, my first edit was at  00:27, 31 August 2009 which was when I added the note. The edit right after that, was me, improving the note. Right after this second note, Rlevse reverts my edits. After he does so, I revert his revert and ask that he keep it the way it is while the topic is in discussion. That was it.

Hi  - Yes I do really believe there is a rational explanation for why these types of cults exist in the US but are unknown elsewhere.

@Jytdog:  I agree with  that your personal views about how regulation works and how well it works is not relevant at all here, and it is a distraction.  Additionally, your definitions of """"mainstream"""" do not comport with Wikipedia.  Wikipedia defines Mainstream as follows:
Mainstream refers to a current of thought that is presently widespread.  It includes all popular culture and media culture, typically disseminated by mass media.
The mainstream popular majority view is that GMO's are not safe and should be labelled, and with your familiarity with the Genetically modified food controversies article, I'm sure you are well aware of that.  But I'll provide RS anyway.  For example:  [this].  Also, 93% of Americans think GMO's should be labelled according to this New York Times survey.  So the """"mainstream"""" view of GMO's, GMO safety and labeling and adequacy of regulation does not comport with your views of what """"mainstream"""" means.
We all know that Wikipedia is not going to report the mainstream view as if it were a fact, because the public can be wrong and so can the media.  So Wikipedia relies instead on the """"mainstream scholarship"""" WP:VALID or """"mainstream scientists"""" WP:PSCI as experts, not the public and not the views of civil servant regulators, farmers, firefighters or lawyers who are """"in the trenches"""".  This bizarre tangent saying that low level regulators are mainstream """"experts"""" is not helpful to improving the article, because it has nothing to with WP:RS and WP:PAG.
Please let us focus on correcting the """"scientific consensus"""" statement that was not sustained by your RfC and in this section addressing 's proposed statement.  Please provide solid RS to back up your objections and assertions, rather than giving personal opinions and expecting us to trust your views are solidly based on RS, especially when RS is provided that says otherwise.  These tangents are distracting and in my opinion wasting our time, which has the effect of keeping the status quo defective sentence in place.  You have agreed that the sentence needs revision, and you have been asked a number of times to provide an alternative sentence, which you think would gain consensus, and I have yet to see it.  What I see is opposition and distraction to attempts to improve the problematic sentence.  Please let us stay focused on improving the article  """,0,0,0

Here are some other hints and tips:

 I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many benefits of having a username.

 When using talk pages, please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

 Lead is too narrow 
The lead states """"Adherents of the 9/11 Truth Movement deny that al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airliners and intentionally crashed two into the World Trade Center buildings"""". I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn't preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn't preclude the use of explosives. I'm not a die hard truther, but I don't belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn't seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement). I guess these people (who seem to get all their 'facts' from Fox and CNN) explain why the US government is able to get away with gradual erosion of liberties (PATRIOT, NDAA, TSA, etc).

 I engaged in no personal attack. What I did what point out that Headbomb's edits were illiterate and incoherent (and incompetent in the sense of being unobservant of literacy and coherency). Headbomb himself admitted as much by correcting merely some of the illiteracies and incoherencies which I pointed out to him (while leaving most of the problems he introduced intact), of which corrections are totally unneeded if Headbomb would stop repeatedly introducing them. Headbomb's edits are purely destructive. He has added no information to the article; he has simply deleted information, and that while introducing illiteracies and incoherencies.

 He also has issued bizarrely false statements about his edits, such as stating that """"Tipler is not known for either the 'purported physical proof of God' nor any recognized quantum theory of gravity/TOE."""" Yet that's what the only two sections in the """"Academic work"""" section state that Prof. Tipler is known for claiming.

 Along with the deletion of the links to free book chapters (of which edits had previously been reverted by the Wikipedia administrator Irishguy), the pattern of Headbomb's edits show a clear intent to damage the article due to Headbomb's ideological dislike of Prof. Tipler and his work, of which is further reinforced by the personal information on Headbomb's user page. That is, Headbomb is attempting to get rid of information that would be helpful for others to learn more about Tipler and his work (such as the links to free book chapters; and the infobox """"Known for"""" field which, in the useful form in which I had it, would quickly let people know what Tipler is known for claiming: whereas listing books names and the Omega Point Theory's name would only make sense to someone if they already knew of them, and so they are either purely redundant or unhelpful; etc).

 Whereas I have an actual history of adding value to this article by writing most of the article's text, adding sections, and adding most of the references. I don't point out this fact as a claim of ownership over the articleunlike Headbomb, who has effectively argued to the effect that the supposed """"hard work"""" of his illiterate and destructive edits entitles him to keep the article the way he edited itbut rather to point out that I am actually literate and competent, and that I actually care about making it easier for people to learn about the subject of the article; unlike Headbomb's illiterate and incoherent edits, which get rid of highly useful information in order to make it harder for people to learn about the article's subject.

 The article was doing fine until Headbomb came along. He has acted purely as a troublemaker in regard to this article, due to his ideological dislike of the article's subject.

 You're rewarding a vandal and punishing the one person who has, by far, the greatest proven history of adding value to the article (as most of the article's text was written by me).   """,0,0,0

Thiru Muruga Kirupanandha Variyar, popularly known and reverently called as Variyar Swamigal was born at KangeyaNallur, a small village on the bank of 'Palar' river. This village lies at a distance of 5 km between Vellore and Katpadi in Vellore District. This province is referred to as Thondai Nadu in Sangam literature.

The 25th August 1906 became auspicious day since it has the glory of being the birth date of our Swamigal. (According to Indian Astrology, it was Saturday 4.37 AM, Sukla Patcham, Sasti thithi, Swathi Nakshatram, Subranama Yogam, Gowlawa Karanam, Thula Rasi Kadaga Lagnam)

 
     Swamy's father Siva Thiru Mallaya Dasa Bhagavathar was well known for his discourses on ancient Purana & Ethics. He was a great scholar, his knowledge and wisdom in Purana, Ethics and literature were unlimited. Hence, he was conferred with the title """"Puranethikasa Paarangathar"""". He established 'Thirupugazh Sabhas' in each and every place to propagate """"Thirupugazh"""" , the songs which spell the glory of god Muruga.

  Madhu Shri Kanagavalli Ammaiyar, mother of our Swamigal was a noble, highly discipline calm, affectionate holy woman. She was always align with the thoughts of her husband. Her kindness and helping tendency towards mankind particularly towards poor was endless.     The parents of our Swamigal belongs to Veera Saiva Dynasty (Primarily followers of Lord Siva) got 11 children, the fourth child was our swamigal.

 TAB
     The Almighty now and then exposes his greatness for the well being of mankind makes saints to born in this world. In this chain of saints, our Swamigal known as Deiva Thiru Muruga Kirupanantha Variyar Swamigal came to this world at the beginning of 20th century.Life of Swamigal spread over the devotional activities, Religious rites, particularly Swamigal made Saint Arunagirinathar's 'Thiruppugazh' known to the entire world.

 
'Swamigal established Thiruvarul Dhavaneri Manram' with his own cost and appointed Preachers for propagating the religious and devotional rites and ideals.  Swamigal set himself as a legend for self discipline; above all his life made men to live as men.

Naturally one may not be talented in all subjects One may possess high knowledge in one matter but least about other.

One may be a good orator but not at all a good author.

One may be good writer but not a good orator. Some may possess in depth knowledge in Sangamliterature, but do not possess any knowledge or interest in literature pertaining to religion.  Even people who are well versed in religious literature may not do well in music.But our Swamigal had enormous and deep knowledge and practice of all these arts and literature. In short he conquered, devotion, discipline, extraordinary memory power, kindness and vast knowledge of texts.

 TAB
The grand mother of Swamigal lived in Kurnool. There was a great saint known as 'Gurubalam' who possessed many talents (Ashtama Siddies). Out of his power he could turn camphor cubes into golden cubes.One day that grand mother(mother of Swamigal's mother) took her son-in-law MallayaDasar (Swamigal's father) to the said saint Gurubalam to get a golden cube for the her son in law. Saint Gurubalam knew this matter through his spritual thought.He asked """"whether the golden cube which I give last  forever? """"Further he told """"A child is conceived and being grown in the stomach of your daughter Kanagavalli and by the child your entire home will be spread with golden cubes"""". According  to the saints words so born was our Variyar Swamigal.

 
Our Swamigal never stepped into any school. But his father Mallayadasar taught him education, Literature, grammer, music and instrumental music, particularly Veena, Swamigal started reading and learning texts at Third year of his age.Swamigal was capable of authoring Venbas (a sort of Tamil lyric) at his eighth year of age.  At his 12th year he memorized ten thousand poems and authored texts like 'Ashta Naga Bandham', 'Mayil','Vel', and 'Sivalinga Bandams' which were too hard and a challenge for even highly learned scholars.

According to the Veera Saiva customs Swamigal wore Sivalingam(Sivalinga Tharanam) at his fifth year in Pana Patrar Mutt in Thiruvannamalai. Swamigal received upadesam 'Satakkara Mantram' from his father and received upadesam 'Sutchuma Satakkara Mantram' from Thirupugazh Swamigal.Palani Easana Sivachariya Swamigal graced our Swamigal 'Nirvana Dhiksha' and named him as 'Vama Deva Sivam' (Dhikshanamam). Swamigal learnt 'Veena' from Bhramma Sri Then Madam Varadhachariyar.

 
In his early days Swamigal had Dharshan of 'Srimath Pamban Swamigal' . Later once swamigal received Sadakkara Upadesam from Pamban Swamigal in dream. Bhramma Sri Loganatha Iyyer known as Madurai Thirupugazh Swamigal established Thirupugazh Saba at Adi Street",0,0,0

There is no need for you to be so nice to westerner's theories which demean Indian core ideologies.This topic is not so easy to be kept inside a dictionary and used off.This has evolution in it energy in it and any constrictions would be insensitivity.
About sexuality you seem to have removed all obligations about sex.Well even it is a part of Sanathana which is defeated time and again and hence popularly it is told to be conserved duly as it should be.I think you can write about Britney more than this topic.
Don't you read all the discussions above and understand.Don't u have that maturity.
It has reaches into human civilisation and spirituality from idolism to non idolism to meditation.
You seem to one who is trying to be smooth and friendly with English.They aren't ur friends in these matters to come to an agreement .It is people like you who have brought India into such tatters.Making agreements ,making fornications and alliances and defying the own motherland - its all weak ones like you who starting from East India company till partition of India have prostituted the land.
Why don't you go and ask all the Archakas of temples listed in the articles.Get the information.They are the ones who have got knowledge passed the Indian way through Gurukula.There is no original book for Mahabharata or dictionary or websites for Indian topics as they can be malignated by weak ones like you but are passed from Guru to Shishya.
There are somethings which are mystical and remain mystical to commoner and Sanathana tries to explore it.
This same attitude had also lead to tussles between shaiva and vaishnava theories which has created some misunderstanding between Vishnu and Shiva and people like you add more fuel to it.
I would like you to learn and reshape the article with the things in proper places.

 Orlady has followed my edits and repeatedly made probably dozens of accusations, that I am asserting personality defects in others.  That is false, I believe.  The accusation seems like many others Orlady has made, which are arguably personal attacks.  I don't know what she is referring to, about the personality defects.  It adds up to her ascribing a personality defect to me, that I am a person who ascribes defective personalities.  Should Orlady be blocked?

What has been under discussion at wt:CONN has been churning of articles, both of vandalism and of reversions by experienced editors (addressing vandalism and also enforcing unfair/unexplained standards for keeping some unsourced info but disallowing new editors' contributions of same).  I have at times referred to long patterns of edits, after disagreeing with many specific edits.  I do eventually perceive really obvious patterns, like that Orlady is following my edits and finding fault.  That is true;  Orlady does not deny it.  It is nonsensical to prohibit my mentioning that.  It is a statement about the edits, plural.  In the edit that SarekOfVulcan mentions, I term one specific edit """"silly"""" (in challenging whether an NRHP-listed district is NRHP-listed) but I do not call Orlady that term.  Whatever Orlady is asserting I have done, she has done more of towards me.

I don't actually understand the standard SarekOfVulcan is applying with this block.  I don't understand a distinction that can be made about my edits, which would not apply more strongly for Orlady for example.  I have discussed Orlady's edits and she has discussed mine.  SarekOfVulcan seems to be applying some standard about """"discuss edits not editors"""", which is overall probably good guidance for wikipedia.  But, when I become aware of an editor repeatedly, i.e. hundreds of times, engaging in a behavior, and i describe that behavior as a pattern of edits, I do not think that is prohibited.  It is not helpful to prohibit that.

Note, Orlady has refused mediation previously and has chosen not to answer repeated questions whether she would engage in mediation now.  Above she complains that I did not reply about a private email.  It is a worse offense not to reply to on-line request to engage in mediation.  I requested her to answer whether she would, three times, within this recent discussion and she has not answered. ncram """,0,0,0

"Better quality image of Wyatt Earp 

You uploaded a faded, blurry, B&W; image of Wyatt Earp some time ago, and I believe I've found a better quality and much higher resolution image from the collection of Western author Craig Fouts. There is a much smaller version here that shows more detail of Wyatt's coat, buttons, and vest that appear to match the features on your fuzzy B&W; version. 

I strongly believe they are two versions of the same image. I'm unsure how to replace your image on Commons, or if that's the right course of action. Please advise.

There is another image that some attribute to be Wyatt Earp, but the proof is sketchy. Thoughts?

"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

If the Manx are identified as a separate ethnic group, then why aren't the Channel Islanders?  You want so much to believe that the Normans aren't related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren't even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren't related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen's loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...  When has Brittany declared their loyalty these past 500 years?

At least insular Normandy is still with us and this is a fact that TharkunColl especially hates beyond all doubt, since it means that England still has a major toehold of continual ethnic relations with France (while Hanover has come and gone).  He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English """"oppressive influence"""" on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.  On this page, there are several objections to your dual consensus, but TharkunColl calls them fantasy.  Why don't we all gang up on you Francophobes together?

You keep the French out because of this Hanoverian fringe who says the English are Germans.  He supports the errant belief that Hanover is where the English come from as opposed to where Denmark's old sphere of influence was and before the Holy Roman Empire and/or Kingdom of Germany existed.  German princes have no roots in England at allthey have only been recent and foreign: Habsburg, Orange-Nassau, Oldenburg (now Mountbatten), Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (now Windsor).  When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.  There have never been so culturally and socially unpopular royalty in the history of the British Isles, yet for some political reasons...others feel it is necessary to make a stalemate by using a straw man fallacy against the Anglo-French fusion which has been witnessed in posterity; by noting that the Germans are an unpopular choice for inclusionall the while saying that Hanover is where the English people are from.

Please, let historical precedent decide who is a part of the English people vs who is only in governmental or political relation/alliance as a result of religious divisions and Parliamentary dictation of Royal affairs ever since the time of colonialism and especially 1603.  Henry VIII of England neither liked Martin Luther and his Prussian/Hanseatic culture, nor was Anne of Cleves going to provide an heirby choice of a King desparate for heirs.  That was the sentiment of the people, whom if Protestant had some Calvinist/French (Huguenot, Puritan) leanings to the exclusion of others.  Wesley's Hanoverian entrance to our religious climate had as much """"imported spirituality"""", from the Moravians obviously not being part of English dispositioneven if Wyclif and Jan Hus seemed to get along for the sole purpose of dissent, they were false friends and allied by circumstance of a mutual """"enemy"""".  That purported enemy was Rome, the """"Whore of Babylon"""" in some claims.

"According to The University of Michigan’s Animal Diversity Web site (for example this page:

The Talpinae subfamily Scalopinae is synonymous with the term “New World moles and relatives” and consists of two tribes:

One of these is just the [star-nosed mole], which is North American and the only member of its tribe.  

The other tribe is (amusingly to me) named the “Scalopini”, a word synonymous with the term “hairy-tailed moles”, and includes four sub-groups, three of which are exclusively North American, new-world moles.  

But the forth one, though is Chinese!  Specifically, “Gansu Moles!!!!”  How can this be?  There must be some mistake, I think.  If not, something very anomalous and interesting is happening.

"""Haplogroup L lineages are relatively infrequent(less than 1%) throughout Europe with the exception of Iberia, where frequencies as high as 11.7% percent have been reported. These lineages had previously been associated with the African slave trade. However an analysis by Gonzalez et al revealed that most of the L lineages matched Northwest African L lineages rather than contemporary Sub-Saharan L lineages. The authors suggest this pattern indicates that most of the Sub-Saharan L lineages entered Iberia in prehistoric times rather than in more recent periods. 

Haplogroup L lineages are present at low frequencies in Eastern Europe. Though a high diversity of African mtDNA lineages have been detected, few lineages have accumulated enough mutations in Europe to form monophyletic clusters. Malyarchuk et al 2005 detected only two monophyletic clusters, L1b and L3b, in Russians with an estimated age no greater than 6,500 years. Malyarchuk et al 2008 identified African L1b, L2a, L3b, L3d and M1 clades in slavic populations at low frequencies. L1b, L3b and L3d had matches with West African populations, indicating that these lineages probably entered Europe through Iberia. One lineage L2a1a, appeared to be much older, indicating that it may have entered Europe in prehistoric times. This clade was possibly related to L2a1 clades identified in 10 individuals of Ashkenazi heritage from France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia. L2a lineages are widespread throughout Africa, as a result, the exact origins of this lineage are uncertain.

I think the key words here are """"claim to have been molested.""""  Justin was an Internet sex entrepreneur and a high paid male prostitute, who had numerous opportunities to get out of the business had he wanted to do so.  It is only society's blind and blanket characterization of everyone under the age of 18 as having been """"molested"""" when they engage in problematical sexual activity, which permits Justin to make a quick transition from selling his body to selling his victimhood. Rookiee's article was fact-based and properly sourced.  That Justin didn't like it when the facts weren't spun from a victimologist perspective is immaterial.

Wikipedia pretends that it's run by consensus as long as volunteers are happily creating multiple millions of dollars in free intellectual property for Jimbo.  Once that task is largely complete, the truth is revealed, which is that this is basically Jimbo's private BBS where he can do anything he feels like, and the contributions he paid nothing for are his to exploit any way he wishes.

Juicy

Juicy was an American musical duo consisting of siblings Jerry Barnes and Katreese Barnes. The group is best known for the songs """"Sugar Free"""" and Beat Street feature song """"Beat Street Strut"""". The name comes from Mtume' number-one R&B; hit """"Juicy Fruit"""".

Career
They debuted in 1983 with a single called """"Don't Cha Wanna"""" and album Juicy. The album entered the charts following year. 

In 1984, their song """"Beat Street Strut"""" was released by Atlantic Records. The song appeared on the 1984 musical-drama film Beat Street and its gold-certified soundtrack. The song was moderately successful on Billboard Dance chart, peaking #46 in July 1984. 

In 1985, Juicy recorded their second album It Takes Two, which features an answer record to """"Juicy Fruit"""" called """"Sugar Free"""". It peaked at #13 on the Billboard Black Singles chart and #45 on the UK pop chart, and was certified Gold. Another singles from the album include """"Nobody But You"""", reaching number 59 on the R&B; chart.

After the uncharted album Spread The Love was released in 1987 for CBS Associated Records label, the group did not enter charts any more.

 Conflict of Interest 

Pm_shef: This is an attempt to resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in.   

As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP:NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn't mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council-related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. 

Here is the fulltext, from WP:NOT: 

Wikipedia is not a soapbox
Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not:
Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.
Self-promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006 that: """"Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so.""""  Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia:Autobiography and Wikipedia:Notability.
Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small """"garage"""" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate programs. See also WP:CORP for a proposal on corporate notability.
-

I understand that you've written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan-related articles. That's a commendable position. I'm sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents. Do I understand your position correctly? And is this approach of abstention one that you permanently take? If so, I again commend that position. I trust, as I'm sure you do, that the administrators and the contributors to Wikipedia will maintain quality articles about worthy and reputable subjects.  """,0,0,0

My own guess would be that it is a religious reference: that the three wise men referred to are, the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost.

You have to go to Don McLean's 'American Pie' for this.
 
""""...and the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, they caught the last train for the coast, the day the music died, and they were singing..."""" 

The wise men come down from heaven (Blunt). Having caught the last train for the coast (McLean), those three men buy a semi by the sea (Blunt). 

On this basis, this song may be a general rant against human nature, mankind having mainly turned their backs on God. 

On earth, the 'wise men' (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) can't escape from bad human beings, and are actually sorry to have created mankind in the first place (mankind generally being """"pernickety little bastards in your fancy dress / Who just judge each other and try to impress"""".) 

God only made man because he was """"trying to have some fun"""", but he made a mess of the product (i.e. human nature is imperfect) and now he can't 'escape from' mankind, can't 'be free from' mankind, And has 'no way out' of the problem that mankind is, and the imperfect creation God has made on earth. So God takes refuge from us on the coast.
 
As individuals, and as the human race collectively, if we proceed in a godless way, we have to ask ourselves the question """"Where are we now?"""" 

Blunt isn't alone however, as he himself has God. 

Only my guess. Pure speculation. Probably well wide of the mark, I suppose someone else will tell me.

 need update to 1st source, in lede: that src now says Multiregional took away RAO's formerly """"mainstream"""" status, in the book's 2012 edition.  Also: reasons to support a long ignored proposal to unlock the article. 

A new edition of The Essence of Anthropology (by McBride B, Haviland WE, Prins HEL, Walrath D) is available, dated 2012.  This article is still citing the 2009 edition of the same book.

Note that the new, 2012 edition says  on pg. 94:
""""Until 2010, the recent African origins hypothesis was the mainstream position. But when researchers from the Max Planck Institute released a study comparing the Neanderthal genome...the genetic evidence shifted to supporting the multiregional hypothesis.[19]""""

This article's statement of RAO being """"the most widely accepted model..."""" was relying on the outdated 2009 edition of this book having said, on pg. 90 of the 2009 edition, that RAO """"is"""" the """"mainstream"""" position; the sentence involving what is """"mainstream"""" was revised in the 2012 edition, to say that the evidence now """"supports"""" the multiregional hypothesis.

This article's first sentence should therefore read (edits are in italics): """"...dubbed the """"Out of Africa"""" theory, was the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans, until the Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans gained favour.""""

-

-

Also, who has kept the article locked for years and what is their reason for why it is still locked? Are the sources for each of these competing hypotheses so dubious and disputed?

And did the pro-RAO vandal himself lock this article, and then quit WP, or has had his account suspended, or what?
Why else is there no response to complaints about this article being locked for such a long-term, but that the one who locked it has long ignored this article and cannot be trusted to lock articles (if he is even still a WP member)? Per the fact-based accusations that were raised in the above topics in this Talk page, it should be unlocked in order to add the discoveries (I'd say """"recent discoveries,"""" except that 2010 isn't recent, which again exhibits that nobody holding a WP account is responsible enough to be trusted with the locking of this article, especially not an anthropologist or even anthro student, because if this article had even one expert editor, he should recognise immediately that the above edit requests are from veracious sources and are the reasons for the requests are explained explicitly enough that anyone worth their salt should comprehend what's being requested).

Others posing this question about why this article is locked have been unanswered for roughly a year, so who locked this article, then ignored this badly neglected, scientifically outdated article, for so long? And ironically, the people who want it unlocked are desiring to update this article with recent facts, i.e. discoveries, that refute RAO, so obviously none of us are the pro-RAO vandal, but this article was locked for years (literally) even before that complaint of a list of edits by a pro-RAO vandal was raised on the Talk page, again raising my question: Did the pro-RAO vandal make his edits to corrupt the veracity of this article, and then skip town, so to speak? 209.97.203.60  """,0,0,0

Melanin Factors

Karanja Keita Carroll

One of the most controversial areas of Afrikan/Black psychology is the role of melanin within certain areas of theory and research. While this topic is controversial and actually causes some to disregard this research, we must continually critically investigate the theories and research that is produced around this biological chemical of life. Azibo (2002) actually argues, â€œ[t]his area of study is deserving of our best scholarship, not our ignorant, out of hand, and deferential to white sensibilities derisionâ€ (p. 429). In accord with Aziboâ€™s statement, this essay will attempt to systematically engage the role of melanin within humans, and Afrikans in particular. The information presented here will also show the connections Afrikan/Black psychologists are able to make between melanin and Afrikan behavioral functioning. 

Melanin can be defined as a class of pigments found in the cosmos. Etymologically the term comes from the Greek melanos, meaning black (Barnes, 1988). There are four major types of melanin: eumelanin, phaeomelanin, allomelanin and neuromelanin. Each type of melanin represents a different composition and location within the body. While the first three types of melanin can be found throughout areas of the body, neuromelanin is the only type of melanin found in the brain (Owens Moore, 1995; King, 1991a, 1991b). The most important feature of melanin is its ability to absorb, retain, store and regenerate energy.

To understand the importance of melanin to optimal human functioning we must look at the foundation of creation in human beings. This process is known as embryogenesis. According to Bynum (1999),

During embryogenesis or the development of the embryo in the uterus, there is an interesting unfoldment. After conception the female egg begins to divide into a cluster of fetal cells called a blastula. The initial blastula unfolds three distinct layers of cells, the outermost level or ectoderm, the inner layer or endoderm, and the mesoderm...The ectoderm layer contains melanin in high concentrations throughout its region (Pearse, 1969; Pearse & Takor, 1976). Only 28 hours after conception, the ecotoderm has moved into the interior of the blastula and begun to form a neural tube. During embroygenesis0 this neural tube develops into the precursor of the brain and spinal line. The neural tube unfolds into the spinal cord, the end of the tube or the neural crest mid-point develops into the brain, and very importantly, the cells along the tube evolve into light sensitive melanocyctes, which eventually develop into all of the endocrine glands, e.g., pineal, pituitary, adrenal, mast cells, hypothalamus, thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas and others that will develop in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and heart (King, 1990; Welbourn, 1977). (p. 148-159)

While this extensive quotation by Bynum clearly shows the role of melanin in the embroygenesis process, what must be understood is that without melanin in this process, life does not begin.

Also, from this extensive quotation, we are able to see the many areas melanin affects the human system. The most important layer of the blastula is the ectoderm which creates the neural tube, neural crest, and the epidermal layer. The neural tube and neural crest will transform into the brain and spinal cord (Central Nervous System/CNS) and the external sense organs (ears, eyes). The epidermal layer will transform into the epidermis and epidermal tissues. The CNS controls the sensory, neuromuscular, hormonal organs of the body. Impairment of the CNS affects human sensitivity, movement and consciousness (Owens Moore, 1995). Ultimately with this discussion of the ectoderm, we see that as the Afrikan worldview states, everything is interrelated and connected. This will have a profound effect upon the impact of melanin on behavioral functioning.

From this very general overview, we come to recognize the role of melanin throughout the human organism. Areas of importance that have high levels of melanin include the epidermis, hair, eyes, ears and brain. Within the brain, specifically the brainstem, locus coloreous, substantia nigra, pituitary gland and pineal gland (Barnes, 1988; King, 2001a, 2001b). 

The role of melanin within embryogenesis lays the foundation of melanin throughout the human organism. What must be stressed is the fact that all organisms have melanin, but the level and proportion of melanin distribution strictly reflects oneâ€™s historical relation to their environment (Lasker, 1969)",0,0,0

It reduced customary exports to Italy, Spain, Japan, Chile, and Peru, selling nearly all of its exportable corn and grain sorghum surplus to the Soviet Union. In return, it received prices of almost 25 cents over the American selling price from the desparate Soviet foreign trade organization responsible for grain imports, Export Khleb. In addition, Export Khleb wooed Argentina into an agreement to sell 20 million tons of corn and grain sorghum, and 2.5 million tons of soybeans to the Soviets over the next five years. The Soviet Vice Minister of Foreign Trade even predicted in April a tripling of total trade between the USSR and Argentina in the next few years.""""

Image can be resized, moved, cropped and upload as second image (with same permissions) whatever, but thought I'd better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan.  

 It's not an orphan, since Simon Baron-Cohen points at it. I'd really rather not have this image in Asperger syndrome, for reasons already discussed. This article already highlights SBC's theories too much, at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable; including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already.  

He actually gave it for this article, so let's try and see what the consensus is? There is no reason why you shouldn't get images of other """"eminent contemporary researchers"""" as well to balance?  
Other editors, such as SandyGeorge, have complained about a lack of images in this article. Delete this one and there is only one small image of Asperger. Zeraeph is right, get more images to balance it, don't just delete.  

Getting more images of other eminent researchers would """"balance"""" the article only in that it would be better to have images of Ehlers, Frith, Gillberg, Happé, Klin, Ozonoff, Rogers, Volkmar, Wing, etc., than having just Baron-Cohen. But this would be changing the article in the wrong direction (not to mention being a source of further disputes). Asperger syndrome should focus on AS, not on AS researchers. With the exception of Asperger himself and maybe Wing, who were instrumental in the history of the disorder, the other researchers just don't make the cut. Rather than head in this direction, the article would be better off stealing the images from Autism. If you take a look at the images in Autism, all but one are far more relevant to AS than this image of Baron-Cohen is.  

I agree with Eubulides. SBC is already over-represented, and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. Maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a 'who's who gallery' of AS researchers (for those attached to this idea).  

I agree with Eubulides and Soulgany101.  Yes, we need images, and there are images that could be used to illustrate AS; SBC isn't one of them, and gives undue weight to one researcher's views.  His image should be used in his article, where anyone curious about him can find it (but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off).   (Talk) 01:""",0,0,0

et tu JamesMLane?? I was always told you were the persuasive one because of your cool calm reasoned responses and up until now I had no reason to doubt this and have always accorded you the respect of analyzing your arguments and either agreeing or disagreeing.

But you both shock and surprise me with a personal attack in your very fist sentence. To suggest that I'm some knee-jerk reactionary spoling for a fight with the left wing cabal is to caricature me in a grossly distorted way. I

'm here to remove POV. Period. Now, it is acknowledged by you and others that there are currently a preponderance of liberals in here doing the editing, although no one until you would be willing to admit that there was a left-wing cabal and a sinister one at that!  
(Remember, you can't say you were 'just joking' because, as we've learned from the liberal editors of the Ann Coulter piece, unless you SPECIFICALLY say 'I was joking' when you make your statment, it means you're as serious as AIDS- so I thank you for that illuminating revelation. It is duly noted.)

Anyway, it stands to reason that most of the POV I will encounter is going to be coming from the left. Do you dispute that or do you think this Karl Rove article is filled with right wing hyperbole?

As for your arguement - """"we have to interrupt his biography to go off on a side excursion, an article-within-an-article that discusses the subject he addressed..."""" I can only say McCain...Black Baby Rumor...see above. lol! 

I find it hard to believe you can make that arguement with a straight stroke. It is PRECISELY that tit for tat meandering that is the HALLMARK of Ann Coulter and Karl Rove articles. I wish you'd use your persuasive powers to address the McCain push poll incident and Ann Coulters alleged love for terrorists instead of cherry-picking it in a realm where Rove might actually be vindicated.

So, I reject your argumentation for now. In fact, I've understood that Move-On's petition may have been specifically what Rove was referring to. Therefore to omit this information would be a deliberate attempt to leave that quote hanging out there and thus tantamount to POV by default.

And I think one 911 family group comments deserves another. Or, if you like, we can just use the conservative 911 family group's statements. Since we  don't want to make this article 'book-length' do we? 

Here's my bottom line: What's good for the goose is good for the gander. And what I've seen here since day one is one form of argumentation used to defend an article if it's good for the goose (democrat/liberal) and that EXACT SAME ARGUMENTATION trashed if it looks good for the gander (republican/conservative.) I hope you don't think I'm the only one who sees this. (Oh btw, when I make post these trenchant observations, I'm used to getting rebuked for 'getting away from content' or 'talking politics.' Funny, how your comments of the exact same nature never get that same rebuke.  Must be 'cabal club' privileges, huh? ) Take care Big Daddy. Ps I do like your style though.

Since Netto is a Danish store, I assume that the numbers on the Danish page are the most updated, and that the other country pages are translated from it.  | talk 

 Arson 

The Keighley store was destroyed by arson as well, in about 1998. Of course, before it burnt down baked beans were 7p. After it burnt down, they went up to 10p because they were cooked.

lol is that a joke or is it serious? if joking its funny

It is true that the Keighley store burned down, it moved out to Crossflatts while it was being rebuilt. The bean prices, though, were just a joke that were being passed around at the time.  

 Request for info review 

I've just had a look at this selection and I don't think it should belong in this article.  This is the section

The cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. The fire broke out at around 4am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. The fire was not completely put out until about 12pm. It is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. Netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness, being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. It is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there, as to insult the receiver (due to Netto being known for its cheapness). 

My view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at Netto.  I personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely?   The schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article.  This is an encyclopedia not a local news paper!!

Fat is never converted to Glc, not at least in humans according to the textbooks.  

Let me add few things. First, Glc enters/leaves the cell through a proces called facilitated diffusion. Which means that as soon as the Glc concentration inside the cell is somehow increased, Glc will start leaving the cell - which by the way happens in hepatocytes during glycogenolysis. Second, even if there was a way to keep Glc inside the cell, say through active transport, Glc poses a danger to the cell integrity as Glc is a highly osmotically active compound. The cell solves these two issues with a single solution by synthesizing glycogen from Glc - the enormous glycogen molecules can't leave the cell, and by having osmotically inert glycogen instead of Glc, the cell avoids the osmotic shock.  13:55, 30",0,0,0

 Let's Clarify Something here 

First of all, nice to meet you Stephanie Adams. I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)

I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.

Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in """"Used to.... but does not anymore""""

I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, """"Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage"""" then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.

I'm sure he's also mentioned in History of Prince George by Runnalls as well. Millar was a big part of our history and a large subdivision here carries his name. He was somewhat of a land speculator, and he very nearly owned Prince George. He tried to buy the land right out from under the GTP's nose, as they were footdragging, as they often did. Anyway, the GTP and Millar quarreled for years over the townsite and bridges and their rival sternwheelers. But the histories are clear that it's the same man, a Toronto lawyer and all that.",0,0,0

"""

First, this article does not talk about a """"class of dog"""" in the sense that a """"poodle"""" is a class of dog. It talks about a use of certain types of dogs. To chase """"quarry"""". This sets a context for these dogs (the matter of fact tone suggests approval of this use of a dog, as does, very much so, that the first requirement for a working dog is that someone should work it!). Describing what the dogs do as """"work"""" is strongly biased to a positive view of it. I do not strongly object to this, although it could be rephrased into a """"voice"""" that took things less for granted.

Second, many readers will not automatically realise that one is talking about dogs that could be used in fox hunting, yet this is primarily what they are used for at least in the UK. The article largely discusses terrier work in the UK, framing its history in terms of enclosure, which is not an issue in the States or elsewhere, because enclosure practices differed in other places. So the intro should note this, and having done so, making note in some detail why it is controversial (not just that it is) serves to balance out a piece that is far too sympathetic to one POV.

Third, the article on the Hunting Act is not specific on this issue, and it's appropriate to give it in some detail (if it is appropriate to go into as much detail about terrier work in the UK, which the article does). You should either slash the article to its generic elements and put the slashings into an article on Working terriers in the United Kingdom or accept that given the form of the discussion, a focus on UK responses is appropriate.

That's all well and good, but I have one major objection: present tense is how we discuss legend and literature in the English language, even if they never did happen, and even if it is a retelling of the distant past (see , for example). Unless there is a WP guideline for fiction that I am seriously missing, the present tense is correct. -NOOO 
Nonsense. If this is being done absolutely to-the-letter correct, it should be very clear when things are taking place (and I don't think it's going to be that hard, considering how little backstory most characters have). It would be something like:

In SS, character is motivated by meh.
Prior to SS2, character is on trip to ___ and does not make appearance.
In SS2, character etc. etc.

 A tag has been placed on Bivattchee requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Æµ§œš¹ There is an Afrocentiric view of the world and there is a non Afrocentric view.  As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora.  The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics.  The counterfeiters and plagiarizers that have for years attempted to filch the word Ebonics and with the intent to deceive used the word Ebonics as a synonym for BE, AAVE and other such appellations clearly have Hoary confused. [See Smith (1997) and Smith and Crozier (1998)].   In the “About Wikipedia” section on the main page of  Wikipedia we are told the following as the etymological origin or genesis of the word “Wikipedia”:  “Wikipedia (pronounced /ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdi.ə/ WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project based on an openly-editable model. The name """"Wikipedia"""" is a portmanteau of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning """"quick"""") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links to guide the user to related pages with additional information.”  Now, just as the word Ebonics is a is portmanteau of the words ‘ebony’ and ‘phonics’ the word or name Wikipedia is portmanteau of the words ‘wiki’ and ‘encyclopedia’.  According to the ‘About Wikikpedia’ section the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is from the Hawaiian word ‘wiki’ meaning ‘quick’ not the word ‘wickyapi’ an Algonquian Indian language from which the word ‘wickiup’ is derived.  Thus the word Wikipedia is not derived from the Algonquian Indian word ‘wikiyapi’ and it origin has nothing to do with the word’wickiup’ that means “a hut used by nomadic Indians of the arid regions of the western and southwestern U.S.” (see Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (2001:1347)  As defined by its author the word or name ‘Wikipedia’ is not a portmanteau of the word ‘wicked’ and ‘pedophile’ and it has noting to do with “wicked pedophiles”.  User Hoary thinks it is allright to encompass meanings for the word ‘Wikipedia’ that the founders of ‘Wikipdeia’ never intended and defend the use of any and all counterfeit meanings on the web all over the world. 
I accept what is presented in quotes above as being the origin and true meaning of the name “Wikipedia”.   I believe the meaning posited for Wikipedia above is the only authenthic meaning of word ‘Wikipedia’.   I wonder how the author(s) originator(s) of the name ‘Wikipedia’ would feel if there were counterfeiters and plagiarizers going all over the world misrepresenting and outright mis-using the name “Wikipedia”?

Now that the newspaper and the building have parted ways, it's time for the Wikipedia content to do likewise. This would allow the geographic coordinates of the Philadelphia Inquirer article to show the location of the Philadelphia Inquirer, rather than that of the building that formerly housed it.",0,0,0

I thought you might find it useful to have some information about  references (refs) on wikipedia. These are important to validate your writing and inform the reader. Any editor can remove unreferenced material; and unsubstantiated articles may end up getting deleted, so when you add something to an article, it's highly advisable to also include a reference to say where it came from. Referencing may look daunting, but it's easy enough to do. Here's a guide to getting started. If you need any assistance, let me know.  '''''''' 

Good references

A reference must be accurate, i.e. it must prove the statement in the text. To validate """"Mike Brown climbed Everest"""", it's no good linking to a page about Everest, if Mike Brown isn't mentioned, nor to one on Mike Brown, if it doesn't say that he climbed Everest. You have to link to a source that proves his achievement is true. You must use reliable sources, such as published books, mainstream press, and authorised web sites. Blogs, Myspace, Youtube, fan sites and extreme minority texts are not usually acceptable, nor is original research (e.g. your own unpublished, or self-published, essay or research), or another wikipedia article.

Inserting a reference

The first thing you have to do is to create a """"Notes and references"""" section (unless it already exists). This goes towards the bottom of the page, below the """"See also"""" section and above the """"External links"""" section. Enter this code:

==Notes and references==
{{reflist}}

The next step is to put a reference in the text. Here is the code to do that. It goes at the end of the relevant term, phrase, sentence, or paragraph to which the note refers, and after punctuation such as a full stop, without a space (to prevent separation through line wrap):

             

Whatever text you put in between these two tags will become visible  in the """"Notes and references"""" section as your reference.

Test it out

Open the edit box for this page, copy the following text (inserting your own text where indicated), paste it at the bottom of the page  and save the page:

==Reference test==

This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.Reference details go here

==Notes and references==

{{reflist}}

(End of text to copy and paste.)

It should appear like this:

Reference test

This is the text which you are going to verify with a reference.Reference details go here

Notes and references

Information to include

You need to include the information to enable the reader to find your source. For an online newspaper source, it might look like this:

Plunkett, John.  [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1601858,00.html """"Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying""""], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  2005-10-27. Retrieved on 2005-10-27.

When uploaded, it appears as:

Note the single square brackets around the URL and the article title. The format is:

 Numbers 

1.000 Serbs killed by terrorist albanians? Is someone kidding to me? NATO, USA, Clinton claimed Serbs killed 500 000 albanians (in truth they killed thousands of terrorists in self defense actions in Serbian Kosovo) and that albanians killed 1.000 Serbs. Terrorist so called """"KLA"""" killed both albanians (they considered that are cooperating with Serbs) and Serbs. Today many of murders on albanians commited by terrorist """"KLA"""" are attributed to Serbs.

Anyway, it's on you who are you going to believe, USA that said 500 000 albanians were killed for 3 years, while only 1.000 Serbs were killed, or Serbs who claimed 10.000 Serbs were killed. If they would lie, they would say 100.000 Serbs were killed or something like that.

I believe we should change number of killed Serbs to at least 4.000 to 10.000, if you don't agree with me tell me why and let's discuss it. And yeah if someone doesn't delete albanian lies from this articles I will send pictures of Serbian baby Sava burned allive near prizren in 1999, Serbian baby slaughtered near Gnjilane, burned churches etc. and then ask youreslves who was ethnic cleansing who. Anyone who has at least little brain could see demographic cards from those years and you can clearly see that every year Clinton and NATO (USA) claimed that Serbs killed 500.000 albanians, more and more Serbs were killed, so less and less Serbs were those years in this Serbian province.

Mel Bay may cite Marlow as """"something of an authority on the ten-string guitar"""", but also as something of an authority on the ten-string guitar I have reviewed her approach guide and found it misinformative in the following respects:
 
1. In the front matter, Janet Marlow claims that """"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar"""". In truth, Narciso Yepes always, verifiably stated that there are eight notes (from the twelve that make the chromatic octave) that do not have string resonance (i.e. a sympathetic response from an adjacent string). This can be verified in practically any of his various articles and interviews as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: """"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale."""" That is not only on six-string guitars. Also ten-string guitars that do not have the specific tuning invented by Yepes cannot lay claim to having unison sympathetic string resonances for all the twelve notes in all positions on the treble strings. This is an indisputable fact of acoustics, a science, which as such cannot be fudged.

2. Marlow does not define the term """"resonance"""", which is used in this book in the lay sense rather than in its acoustic/scientific sense. This is evident from the chapter on """"Controlling Resonance"""" in which controlling """"resonance"""" is equated with a vibrating bass string that has been actively plucked. In fact, this is not string resonance, but simply a vibrating string. Resonance is the tendency of a system (like a string) to vibrate sympathetically at a particular natural frequency in response to energy induced at that frequency (that is, on another string). 

3. No adequate explanation of how this resonance actually functions is offered anywhere in this book. In fact, the singular tuning that adds all eight missing resonances is relegated to an aside comment in parenthesis. In addition, it is claimed that the author's """"own"""" method of tuning """"satisfies the needed sustain"""" (Preface). As a fact of acoustics, the author's tuning system does not provide sympathetic string resonance for all the notes of a chromatic scale, nor does it thus equalize the sustain, resonance, timbre, or volume among the twelve notes of the octave (which is the entire primary purpose behind the invention of the modern 10-string guitar). The tuning system used in this method, for example, supplies no resonance for the notes of F-natural and B-flat, neither does it offer any resonance for C's. 

4. In the Preface, Marlow claims that """"In my own process over twenty five years I have developed the tuning"""" that forms the basis for this method. In fact, this method of tuning had already been fully developed by 1982, not """"over twenty five years"""". Records of this are in the March 1982 edition of Guitar Player magazine, in an interview with Marlow by Allan Kozinn. Furthermore, this concept is therein attributed to Oscar Castro-Neves (March 1982: 20), not to Janet Marlow's """"own process"""". 

5. The transcriptions of baroque music (by Bach and Weiss) offered in this book are fraught with stylistic problems too numerous to list but for a few. For example, the ornaments (which are an integral part of baroque music) have been inexplicably omitted (eg. trills in bars 8 and 15 of the Weiss Courante). Furthermore, stylistically inappropriate melodic intervals have been introduced in the bass line. For example, in bars 1-3 of the Courante, instead of the smooth bass line moving by steps from A2 to G#2 [minor 2nd] to F#2 [major 2nd]) - as intended by Weiss in good baroque style - we find erratic leaps of an augmented octave [A2 to G#1] and a minor 7th [G#1 to F#2]. Where this descending line should be structurally mirrored in bars 36-38, we find again an erratic undermining of the formal and stylistic elements of the composition, simply to keep the bass notes on open strings. As such it seems rather insincere that the author lists """"the correct use of octaves and bass lines intended by the composer"""" as a justification for using the 10-string guitar when this is clearly not the case in her own use of the instrument. Also, very little consideration seems to be shown for open basses ringing together where they should not, for example, the first three bass notes of the Courante all continue to ring together forming two dissonances (augmented octave and minor 7th) where the composer intends a clean line in the bass. That is, the bass line should be a melody, not a cacophany of dissonant harmonic intervals. (I refer also the the DVD version of this book, now discontinued, on which Marlow performs her transcription.)

Ermie Smith writes
Æµ§œš¹  You asked me to cite other inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article on Ebonics.  I direct your attention to the Wikipedia article on the “Oakland Ebonics Controversy”.  The Wikipedia article states:  “For students whose primary dialect was AAVE, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in that dialect, both for """"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills."""" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both AAVE and Standard English to the level of those teaching LEP (limited English proficiency) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAVE themselves.[1]”      This not accurate.  In fact it is an outright lie.   In the first place, the OUSD Board's December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) """"Ebonics"""", (2) """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" and/or (3) """"African Language Systems"""".   As proof of this assertion I cite the fact it that the appellations African American Vernacular English does not appear anywhere in the entire OUSD resolution.  In fact the first four Whereas clauses of the OUSD resolution speak only to the existence of a linguistic continuity of the West Niger-Congo African language system in the language of African slave descendants and their unique language stature.   The very first whereas clause of the OUSD resolution states: WHEREAS, numerous validated studies demonstrate that African-American students as part of their culture and history as African people possess and utilize a language described in various scholarly approaches as “Ebonics” (literally Black sounds) or “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” or “African Language Systems.”  [For more information relative to the appellation “Pan African Language Communication Behaviors” see Pan African Language In The Western Hemisphere (1973)]  The second Whereas clause of the resolution states: “Whereas, these studies have also demonstrated that African language systems have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages  and are not merely dialects of English”.   Now what more evidence does it take to prove that the OUSD resolution was not about African American Vernacular English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution?
Here is more.  A critical analysis will reveal that in its very essence the OUSD resolution was about the vindication of the equal protection of the law rights of the Afrocentric parents and their children under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  That is, the right of English Language Learners (ELL) of African ancestry to not be discriminated against on the basis of their language ancestry and provided instruction in the English language as a second language, i.e.,ESL.  In short, to be provided a Free and Appropriate Public Education.   As proof of this assertion I cite the fifth whereas clause of the OUSD Board's resolution which reads: """"Whereas, judicial cases in states other than California have recognized the unique language stature of African American pupils, and such recognition by courts has resulted in court-mandated educational programs which have substantially benefited African American children in the interest of vindicating their equal protection of the law rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the  United States Constitution.""""  (See OUSD resolution page 1. para. 5.)  As further evidence that the OUSD Board's resolution was about """"Ebonics"""", """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" or """"African Language Systems"""" and not African American Vernacular English, I cite the fact that first ‘Now Therefore Be It Resolved’ clause of the OUSD resolution states: “NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED the Board of Education officially recognizes the existence of, and cultural and linguistic bases of West and Niger -Congo African Languages Systems and these are the language patterns that many African American students bring to school;”  Clearly based on this passage of the resolution what the OUSD Board was addressing was the existence of  """"Ebonics"""", """"Pan African Communication Behaviors"""" or """"African Language Systems"""" and not African American Vernacular English.   The second “Therefore be it resolved” clause of the OUSD resolution states:  “BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Educ",0,0,0

 A Short History of Progress edits 

Hi there Maclean, I will try to keep this short. I noticed your rewrite and you did some good work (and a lot it too) and thanks for that: plenty of review references also. 
Although I actually prefer the original but this is probably a matter of style and preference.
The good side is that now the original is defunct and no longer published at Wikipedia I can effectively take it back at least by fact although I know not really by law.  I am going to move on from Wikipedia into my own blog...
Things have a habit of getting dumbed down here particularly into mediocre and ineloquent English.
It is a bit cookbookish now: section by section of the Author's book...
Also I don't actually like the Background paragraph style as this should go into the Author Bio page otherwise you would have repeat it for ever Article for every book by that Author!?
Hence the downside of a cookbook or templated approach. 
Question: are foootnoted references to say comparison with other Authors considered original Research?
Also I couldnt find your original ref online but Martin Scoresse does not appear on Cinemaginaire's page for the film as an executive producer - given his preemminence I would pretty much take this as indicating that he is no longer associated with the project?
Also although you keenly summarized/precis some of the quotes (particular the first intro one) there were a few bits (perhaps cut down) I would still like to see in the article particularly from his concluding remarks """"an ice age hunter gather, clever but seldom wise"""" etc and the last Easter islander bit as they are muost poignant and expressive rendered thus in the authors own words than in a cookbook summary of the book.  (I had this same difficulty once summarizing Nietzsche for an essay and in the end largely used the authors own words: how can one after all precis Nietzsche!)
Please don't be offended.  Maybe we should collaborate a little as I have no doubt that we will get a better result than either of us would otherwise on our own. 
Respond here or at my User Mattjs discussion page. (I rarely log in any more but will do so to check.) I will check back here in a few weeks or so (maybe longer) and make a few changes above after your feedback.
Regards 122.148.41.172   (Now i'm off to print and save an older copy for the Article for myself ;-))""",0,0,0

"Carcass Wikipedia 

Hello,

I hope you are well. My name is Bill and I play guitar in a band called Carcass. It appears you have taken it upon yourself to edit our Wikipedia page, even going so far as to undo any recent attempts on our part to correct the numerous mistakes that are present. Now, while we do appreciate that there may be good intentions at work, the bottom line is that someone we have never even met has decided that they know more about our band's history than we do. And that is annoying, to put it mildly.

If all of this was done from a fan's perspective and a genuine (if misguided) desire to set the record straight, I must thank you for your efforts. In many ways I can relate to that position as I still consider myself a fan of music first, a musician second. But I also know I wouldn't ever have the nerve to try and govern any of my favourite bands' Wikipedia pages.

Given that this is the insane world of the internet, I won't make the rash assumption that you are actually an admirer of our band. This wouldn't be the first time that someone who dislikes us has chosen to spread misinformation online. But in the (perhaps unlikely) event that you are interested and prepared to listen, let me know and I will explain which details are wrong, and why. There are quite a few and in all honesty I don't want to waste my time going through all of this unless you are genuinely concerned.

All the best,

Also, as someone who is part of the LGBT community and has been intimately aware of AIDS and those with it since the early-80s, I can tell you that """"resentment"""" isn't really accurate.

I can testify as a first hand-witness that it wasn't """"resentment"""" people in the gay community were feeling, it was anger.  And certainly not because of Ryan White's openness of what it was like for someone outside the gay community to contract the disease.  The anger was directed largely at the US government as well as those who insisted that those who did get sick and die, died because of who they were and were being punished.  Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser put a new face to AIDS, most certainly, but I know of *no one* in the gay community (and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community, I think I would have a better perspective than someone who isn't no matter how close they think they are/were to those in the queer world) who felt """"resentment"""" over the attention AIDS received after their AIDS diagnoses became public knowledge.

"Alison:

I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.

I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.

 more NPOV issues 

This article is pretty sloppy, as I think most people can tell.  I took out the section on first cause as revised by Nodem, which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious, which isn't really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic.

Maybe I went a bit far?  I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?  

If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by """"at some point"""").  I don't think the phrase """"came into existence at some point"""" necessarily implies any metaphysical cause (ie: thing/being 'outside' the universe), does it?  06:59, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate, and maybe link to it from this article, that would be good.  I'm not really qualified to do it.

Also, and I haven't made an edit about this, I'm uncomfortable, as a physicist, with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism.  While many do, and they may be right, I can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one.  Oops!  forgot to login.  I'm misterbailey if anyone was wondering.

You are right to question the most astronomers bitI'll put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces.  I've been working on deterministic system (philosophy), where I put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism, but it is a complex subject.    

I agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes.  And I agree that this article is sort of sloppy.    Perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up?

Herbeck/von Herbeck
Hi, James,  Well, I think there are three separate questions:
 The two articles I merged were most definitely about the same person, unless 2 people with virtually the same name, the same nationality, working in the same field, shared exactly the same day of birth and exactly the same day of death.  Technically possible, but extraordinarily unlikely, I would suggest.  
  Now, there may indeed have been another Johann Herbeck who worked around that time, but I'm no expert and I've never heard of such person.
 As to why the Bruckner biographies have him as Herbeck and not von Herbeck, it's probably because he got his """"von"""" only in 1874, three years before his death.  For the great bulk of his life, he was simply Herr Herbeck, so it's appropriate to refer to him that way in a biog of another person.  For an encyclopedia article, however, he gets his full final name.  

This is a very handy source for some further updates to the article.  Cheers.      """,0,0,0

 Army Medical Services Museum branding equipment 

  Army Medical Services Museum branding equipment Dear Gaius, 

My name is Simon Barnard. I'm an author and illustrator residing in Melbourne, Australia. Currently I'm producing a book on British convicts transported to Australia with Text Publishing. 

Amongst the convicts sentenced to Australia are over 1,000 army deserters, many of whom were branded with a 'd'. Your photo of the branding equipment and human skin located in the Army Medical Museum is of great interest to me. 

I've contacted the Museum in an attempt obtain more information and, in particularly, a photo of the skin, but they're unable to assist.

I'm rather desperate to obtain a decent photo of the skin and am hoping you might be able to help me in this bizarre quest.

The more I think about it, the more I think """"we"""" is the right wording. The problem is that the object of the sentence is """"Penn"""" and without knowing that he said, """"they"""" you're expecting him to use a first person singular, not a first person plural. I think the reason it feels awkward is that when it undergoes the transformation from singular to plural it does become slightly more ambiguous, because """"we"""" refers to a group of people, but only one that includes Penn, which means it's either Penn & Teller or the entire production staff of the show. When you go to """"they"""", it could be any group of people, and because it doesn't say """"he"""", you sort of need to think about what other possible groups Penn could be referring to. Obviously it only takes a few milliseconds to figure out what it means, but if you're reading along at full speed it can break the flow to have that happen.

Regarding the colon wording (Penn said: """"the aim of the show is to ..""""), I understand what  is going for there, but I don't like the way it sounds in that paragraph. When you do it that way, it seems like a non-sequitur. When you have it the other way, it's clear that we, the editors of the encyclopedia, are trying to convey to the readers what the aim of the show is, and we're using Penn's words. When you just say that Penn said something, and the thing that he said is about the aim of the show, the role of that sentence in the paragraph becomes a bit more ambiguous, because it could be that we are trying to convey that this is how Penn thinks about the show, or that we're trying to convey something about Penn himself. I think the way it's written now and where the quote starts removes nearly all that ambiguity. But of course, I could be reading into things way too much. I think it feels natural with the """"we"""" being included in the quote, but maybe  has a better compromise wording that addresses my concerns about non-sequitur.  [talk/contrib] """,0,0,0

No (translator machine), but Ok lets try one piece at time. 
I would appreciate if you could show me what can be done in each of paragraphs:

1st paragraph:
Having been the early Brazilian republican period, nothing more than a Army dictatorship, already in 1891 from the unfoldings of the bubble of encilhamento and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered in a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by several rebellions, both civilian as military, which little by little undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most military, lead a revolt.

2nd:
Vargas and the military, who were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. Under the Claiming of the broken promises of changing, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power and in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

3rd:
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of this period, was followed by a failed attempt to permanently exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I. In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August of 1942, when the country entered in that war on the allied side after suffer retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due the country have severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of Pan-American Conference. With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy """"reinstated"""" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950, Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis.

 Removal of beta service pages/notability issues 

Hi Henrik

I have edited the entry on my father, Keith Lawrence who flew in the Battle of Britain in 1940.  He is still alive and I see him every week.  As well as knowing his date of birth and his general life history, I have access to his Pilot's Flying Logbook, giving completely accurate information about his time in RAF - but this is not a published document.   This information and the Logbook are primary sources, which I have used for the Edits I have done.

I have noted several administrative points:

(a)  It says """"This is very much a beta service and may disappear or change at any time"""", presumably because of the low numbers of people viewing the page.
(b) """"The topic of this article may not meet the general notability guideline. Please help to establish notability by adding reliable, secondary sources about the topic. If notability cannot be established, the article is likely to be merged, redirected, or deleted. (August 2011)""""

My questions are: 
1) If I add secondary sources (confirmation of material relating to Keith Lawrence which is in various published books) does that reduce the liklihood of the article being merged, redirected or deleted?  Or might it disappear anyway, because it is a 'beta service'?
2) If I spend time adding references and citations to secondary sources, is there a time limit for doing this, please?  (For example, 6 months from the August 2011 date mentioned above?)

Basically, I would like to know, please, if it is worth me spending time providing secondary sources if the article will be deleted anyway because of the low number of 'hits' the page receives.

Thanks,

So Strawberry Hills Hotel was proposed for deletion by Wheelchair Epidemic, Ecoleetage agreed and NawlinWiki deleted it.

The article fails to mention the composer 顧家輝, singer 仙度拉, and their song 啼笑姻緣 which overturned the preception that Cantopop as a second grade Music (i.e. for old uneducated person only).  And it was Sammy Hui who finally pushed Cantopop to overtake Mandarin pop as the music of choice for HK youths.

 Tones 

I heard that Cantonese music differs from Mandarin in that Mandarin respects the language tones in the melody, but Cantonese doesn't. Is it true?
 

 Good Cantopops do respect the language tones in the melody, as all Chinese dialects are tone-sensitive. What you heard is a recent disaster in HK music, beautiful face is more important than singing skills and so songs become less important.  But there are still many real musicians care about the tones and the melody. 

Cantonese is more tonal than Mandarin.  Mandarin only has 4 tones for each pronunciation, but Cantonese has at least 6 tones according to most dictionaries.  Some author even claims there are 9 tones in Cantonese.  Even though written Chinese can be pronunced in Cantonese or Mandarin, but the sound differs so much that you cannot sing a Cantonese song in Mardarin nor vice versa.  Many popular tunes get both Cantonese and Mandarin lyrics which are totally rewritten and sometimes with unrelated subjects.   20:31, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Yes but Mandarin has a more pleasant rhythm when spoken with natural darkness and light and this translates into songs pleasnter on the ear.I've heard people talk about Cantonese as sounding like a machine gun on the ear. 

And, how do Cantopop artists deal with music piracy? 
 

 Cantopop artists deal with piracy using the same technique as European or American artists, i.e. virtually nothing they can do!!! 

 But I was under the impression that in HK and Canton, media piracy was much much higher than in Europe or America. But there still are Cantopop artists. Are the economic models different? Do they resort to corporate patronage? ...  

 Curious: How did you hear that """"height"""" in Cantonese areas?  00:40 30 Jun 2003 (UTC)

 I meant South China in general, but it should affect Cantopop. My source is Slashdot . Ehem. I think I read something in Wired of Bruce Sterling finding dirt-cheap pirated media there, but I don't find it. I though tit was common knowledge.  

You have some of the most popular cantopop stars e.g. Joey Yung and Twins going on TV and saying how poor they are and asking their fans not to steal their livlihoods.And yes they do resort to corporate patronage of a sort.In the Joey Yung interview I was referring to, she claimed that she was making no money on her albums, but that she still had to produce albums to keep herself in the public eye and maintain her fanbase. With a large enough fanbase she can make money on personal appearances and concerts.For example Jade Kwan has recently been booked by a chain of bars, in the mainland, for a dozen or so 20 minute mini-concerts.Furthermore if you are popular enough you can make money through endorsments.There isn't a single reasonably attractive female cantopop singer who isn't e",0,0,0

I am a science writer and was working on an article on mirror neurons some two months ago, so I checked it with Rizzolatti (or maybe it was Ferrari, I should look it up in my e-mail). He denied that the finding was serendipitious and that the thing with the banana and the scanner ever happened. Hester van Santen  20:22, 25 December",0,0,0
"I would be interested to know what the consensus of that discussion actually is. In any case, creating redirects is one the areas where you should be WP:BOLD, so I was and I created the two above redirects. On the rare possibility that there is ever consensus to move this article to one of those titles, the redirect can be technically deleted allowing for the move. - MrX",0,0,0
"Well, actually I don't like the opening paragraph, either, as I don't like the title for Imjin War. And I agree with you that their behaviour is inconsistent. It looks like the same thing you experienced happened again. But I'm fed up with useless and exausting arguing with those hopeless burgers. So I didn't go further.",0,0,0

Please see this comment - Its a historic issue from 12 years  ago for which there were no charges or confirmation in any way - supported by a single local archived report and wikipedia as per WP:BLP policy and WP:Do no harm should not become the primary vehicle for such contentious detail. If you dispute this statement then perhaps a thread at the BLPN would be a good idea, please do not replace it wothout support there or here, thanks.   

I saw your comment immediately above, already. I'll have more to say about the long-term edit war over this article (eventually), but not in this section, which is only about the procedural issue concerning talk page use, as far as I'm concerned. The only point I wish to make, here, is that it's not your prerogative to delete other users comments. Please don't do it again.  –   """,0,0,0

(1) I have presented sourced evidence from official government websites (mostly Foreign Ministries or equivalent) that according to the governments of the UK, France and Italy, the EU is a member. 
(2) I have prsented sourced evidence from individual G8 websites, created by respective governments, that the EU is a member.  Nowhere is there any official statement that the EU is not a member. Some people are arguing that when it says the EU joined the G8, the word join has some special meaning (and they must therefore accept that Canada is not a member becasue I have shown the sentence where it says that both Canada and the EU 'joined'). 
(3) I have pointed out that most of the official G8 websites are quoting from the same source, so the contentious phrasing recure. 
(4) Lucy-marie quotes the sentence """"The European Union is represented at the G8 by the president of the European Commission and by the leader of the country that holds the EU presidency."""" Of course it is. This sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their Head of State/Government and is needed simply because the EU does not have a Head of State/Government. It doesn't mean anything else. 
(5) Lucy-marie further quotes """"The EU does not take part in G8 political discussions"""". Of course it doesn't: it would be quite wrong for the President of the Commission to do this since the EU cannot have a single view on these issues, being an association of many countries (some of which are represented in the G8 anyway). 
(6) Nowhere is there a source saying that the EU is not a member. I know, you can't prove a negative, but more significantly THERE IS NO SOURCE to say that the EU has partial membership, or restricted access, or observer status or anything other than full membership. If such exists, it should have been presented by now!

"Hi Enrico! 

Thank you for your message and kind words; they're very much appreciated!   
Thank you also for the correction you're suggesting. I will look into the sources I used for the Planxty reunion dates and locations, and then update this section later on. Normally, I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days. However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia. Of course, if some of these 3rd-party sources are wrong, then it's going to be tricky!
I also notice that you are a brand new user, who has made your first edit today, and to my user page! So, a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here, either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if your user and/or talk pages get supdated very soon with a 'Welcome' message from editors who like to take 'newbies' (= newcomers) under their wings.  
But if you look at my user page, you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines, such as the 'Manual Of Style' (Wiki:MOS). May I also suggest that, if you want some help in getting started as an editor, you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user- and talk-pages. You don't *have* to do any of these things, but if you're interested and have the time, then I'l be happy to help you in your first steps. So, just let me know, OK?
Finally, although I made quite a few changes to the 'Planxty' article (and especially to the 'Andy Irvine (musician)' article), one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not 'belong' to any one editor: we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming 'mine'. In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums. Then, of course, we need more photos but these are very difficult to include because of the copyright rules in Wikipedia.",0,0,0

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.

I'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better. Thanks.  """,0,0,0

Does it still form H2, or more complex compounds?
Does it form compounds with any other elements?
What are its density, melting, and boiling points?
What does it take to convert it back to hydrogen?
Miscibility in solvents?
1) In addition H(1/n)2, where n is an integer > 1, representing the fractional state of a given hydrino pairing, it forms more complex compounds such as hydrino hydride crystals.
2) Hydrinos being a gas, there is no specific density it may have. Detecting the boiling point and melting point of hydrinos requires cyrogenic cooling or exotic pressures. The formation of hydrinos results in increased temperatures. It is unlikely that BLP will place measurement of boiling points and melting points ahead of understanding the catalytic processes which may form hydrinos in the first place.
3) High energy radiation
4) Miscibility is a property that occurs between two or more substances. Hydrinos, being a gas with an effective cross-section much less than ordinary than hydrogen, would be highly immiscible with most substances due to a much greater ease in passing through matter, in such a manner that it will easily escape into space.

There is another source for Tavernor on his derivation of """"plus or minus"""" 
and why he chose """"Smoot's Ear"""" for his title:
http://tech.mit.edu/V127/N43/smoot.html
This is an account by Marie Y. Thibault of Tavernor's speech at MIT 
about his book, with Smoot in attendance.

Both his Preface and his speech have similar structures concerning 
Smoot's Ear and """"plus or minus"""".
Both appear to be explanations of his choice of title.
Both open with """"+ 1 ear"""".
It's presented by Tavernor as the historical basis, i.e., the 
historical measurement as shown by the 1987 plaque, and the 
decades of paint on the bridge.
Both derive """"plus or minus"""" from """"+ 1 ear"""".
Neither states that the historical measurement was """"plus or minus"""". 
Thibault gives a direct quote from Tavernor 'The significance of
Smoot’s Ear is that is stands for an approximation, a “plus or
minus”'.
""""Smoot's Ear"""" is a component of the historical measurement,
""""+ 1 ear"""".
""""stands for"""" is clearly not an historical recounting,
but a reference to Tavernor's interpretation.
He's distinguishing the earlier """"Ear"""" from his contribution,
""""plus or minus"""".

If """"plus or minus"""" were already part of the historical record, it
wouldn't be necessary or desirable to begin with """"+ 1 ear"""".

""""Plus or minus"""" was not part of the historical record, it was
introduced (for purposes of this discussion) by Tavernor as
his interpretation, not part of the historical record.   
Tavernor's account in the Thibault article is clearer on some of 
these points than the Preface, but both seem to achieve the same 
basic end, explaining how the """"ear"""" in """"+ 1 ear"""" from the
measurement on the bridge leads to the ideas in the book, beginning
with """"plus or minus"""", i.e., uncertainty.

Tavernor isn't trying to say that his treatment was on the bridge,
nor measured on the bridge,
quite the contrary, that he took this human measurement, with a
component obviously intended to provoke, inter alia, the notion
of uncertainty, and related it to the whole history of
measurement and made a book of it.

It doesn't matter how many times Tavernor says
the bridge measures 364.4 Smoots plus/minus an Ear.
He could say it 300 times.
He might even say the length of the bridge is 360
Smoots plus or minus an ear.
That has its own truth.
These are only a couple of simple derivative forms 
out of a host of possible derivative forms.
From what are they derived?
Tavernor tells us.
He begins his Preface and book and speech on this subject with
the historical measurement, 364.4 smoots + 1 ear.

Tavernor's first reference citation within his book, for the 
Preface, which certainly seems to be the one he considers most
important, is to what he calls a corroborating interview 
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5043041
That's the one I quoted earlier 
[ 2005-12-07 ]
""""Now how long is the Harvard Bridge if it's measured in smoots?""""
Mr. SMOOT [himself]: 
""""Three hundred and sixty-four point four, plus one ear.""""
It'd be pretty incongruous to argue that he found """"plus or minus""""
there.
Also, he repeatedly cites WP, which at the time, didn't have
""""plus or minus"""".
Contrary to my initial thoughts when his Preface was being
put forward to re-write history, that he was 
not well situated to know about this, he does make it clear 
that he carefully checked into the bridge.
He is a distinguished scholar and an architect who
happens to be in a Dept. of Sociology, who wrote a book that 
seems to be a good read.

Tavernor's Preface was cited on the 
morning of New Year's Day, 2008, as support for the edit of 
Smoot to add ±, but the Preface actually refutes the 
edit by its reference to + 1 ear.
± didn't arise on the bridge; it showed up in Tavernor's
Preface.
Tavernor quotes the 1987 plaque to that effect.

If no one can say what from Tavernor's Preface seems to a) conform 
to WP:NOR and b) support the current language of the 5 
articles, then, yes, this would be an excellent time to revert to 
something only a minor copy-edit different than the language which",0,0,0

"Meijer Gardens, American Horse, Statue copyright
Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.

I was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues.

Gnagarra and Orderinchaos believe it violates WP:UNDUE MickMacNee, Matilda and Carbon Rodney dont.

Quote from WP:BLP

My interpretation:The reason why Gnangarra thinks it violates BLP is because of the availability of only one reliable source. As far as I understand, reliable sources in plural do not mean that it needs more than one reliable source. Even if a strict requirement for multiple sources need to be strictly followed as asserted by Gnangarra, we have more than one instance when Howard was accused of war crimes as noted in the begining of this talk page, including the head of a state. Please remember the key word here is war crime allegations not crimes. Due to these reasons, I personally think that this does not violate BLP (as with many others).

Clarify you are taking my comments out of context, you ask specifically what policies was I quoting for opposing the text. It was the lack of multiple independent sources, ie one reliable source the ABC article, though still questionable as its lacking specific details. In this BLP is clear poorly source contentious material should be removed. garra 

Quote from WP:UNDUE
 and 

My interpretation:
I guess the first quote deals with two different views. An example can be that one view being that the world is round and one being world is flat. In our current dispute, I am not sure what we are comparing. Are we comparing reports that he was alleged of war crimes and not alleged of war crimes (if such reports exists which contradict the ABC news reports) or are we comparing that he was alleged of war crimes and he never commited war crimes. It is hard to make the distinction here.

The second quote says that minority view should not be represented at all except in articles devoted to those views. The content in dispute may fail inclusion as per WP:UNDUE because the belief that he commited war crimes are held by a small n",0,0,0

 Hypocrisy 

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""". He also aggressively removed a legitimate talking point from the article's talk page as """"unsourced bollocks"""". My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article. It was cited (by me) and must have passed some scrutiny to remain in the article. Right?

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities. The truth is, Rodhullandemu began all this anomosity between him and I and it all goes back to this. I'm sure this constitutes a personal attack, especially as I've since been vindicated regarding our feud (ie; I was 100% correct; he was not). So at least issue him with a warning regarding his aggressive conduct. That would be the civil thing to do.   """,0,0,0

"Dutch flag 

The French flag was not inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. This theory put forward by an anonymous user repeatedly in the last days is simply not supported by any proof and seems to be only a (chauvinistic?) guess from that anonymous user. Actually, ironically, I found out that it seems the Netherlands designed their flag in the 17th century based on the blue-white-red colors of the Bourbon of France. According to the French Wikipedia it is King Henry IV of France who suggested these colors to the newly independent Netherlands. Finally, the Netherlands did not have borders with France at the time of the Revolution as the anonymous user wrote. France had borders with the Austrian Low Countries, but not with the independent Netherlands.
 30 June 2005 11:06 (UTC)

The original colours of the Dutch flag were orange, white and blue. King Henry V of France did not suggest to the Netherlands to use red, white and blue. The Dutch started using red because the orange colour was unstable in flag making.

This is not chauvinism. Here are some sources:

He lost his father at age 7 and was taken out of school to live at a village at age 8. He was beaten sensless by his tutor at age 10 and was taken out of his new school again. He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him.

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven. But the search goes on for evidence. The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers, with or without PhDs, to speculate that there may be a""""Plan C"""" where the beings may be neither hoax, (too many sighitngs for that) nor zoological (no body) but instead may be a theoretical space-time creature. This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else. This is being ignored and swept under the rug. Always remember that with no official funding, """"mainstream"""" science has no positive opinion on the topic, and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs, and one paid non-academic.

Now, we, the Six, on the BF Edit Committee in Berkeley, will edit and re edit, and revert 
until the end of time to get the true and correct word out to readers. We will NOT
go away. Editors would be well-advised to work with our suggestions, since we know the literature and most editors never cracked a book. They, except one or two, do not kow squat on the topic, and most are lost in the theoretical quagmire. Most, it seems, 
are also uneducated. Daniel, welcome back.

 Vienna

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on.

HELLOOO, you seem confident in your knowledge, well let me correct you on just a few things: firstly, speaking as one who has lived in an English speaking country since he was born, the word """"nationality"""" has two meanings in any good detailed dictionary, to which ethnic group or its nearest description is both the first of the two, as well as the one which originally defined the word. In the UK, people often enquire about nationality not knowing themselves exactly what the Hell they mean; ask me, I've been there thousands of times. As for """"Citizenship means Nationality"""", that too is inaccurate. Citizenship is merely one form of that type of nationality (legal individual status -  the second description). There are atleast four other strands of nationality which are not citizenship; whoever acquires what is down to the circumstances. Finally, if as you say, the English language nationality means legal status, why apply it to a politician? Where is the sense in a Swedish citizen/national running affairs in Malta? Unless he were Maltese by some form of documentation, there would be a conflict of interest. And even if you can answer that one, perhaps you should check Ibrahim Rugova, remember him?

Scott A Brown knows the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape will never give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape as promised. Scott A Brown wants full credit for the vandialism on the Wikipedia, the removal of the evil Roy Leep from the Wikipedia and the removal of the evil  from the Wikipedia. Then Scott A Brown will stop vandalizing the Wikipdeia. Scott A Brown requests as a good faith thing to make  a banned user of the Wikipedia forever. Scott A Brown also wants the evil CFIF to leave this on his Wikipedia talk page and put this on the evil tvnewstalk.net and tell this to the evil pack of seven who is working with the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown his WCAU as CBS tape as promised and the evil Roy Leep.

 I agree. I have had a small amount of time this evening to do a little research. This 2010 review  could perhaps help in bridging the void. It states that there is a """"lack of consensus"""" and """"robust evidence"""" within the medical literature for things such as penile cancer, STI and UTI, while maintaining there is evidence for HIV prevention (at least in the African trials). If I had the time I would be tempted to run a statistical analysis on the medical reviews themselves! I suspect there would be a clear correlation betweeen the conclusions reached and the country from which they originated. Which brings us (in my opinion) to the crux of the matter. Rightly or wrongly, this is primarily a ritualistic or cosmetic procedure, regardless of what evidence or opinion the medical community has, or will provide. Therefore, to treat this as almost an entirely statistically based article, while only giving a cursory nod to the ethical debate, just feels wrong to me. I am certainly not advocating any bias either for or against. I would be happy to see quotes from Rabbis, Imams, surgeons and scholars.

Probably the third?

Anyway, everyone edited, more or less it matters not, all that matters is were we are and it's all our falt. WE have done this and we'll get out of it. Please don't treat me like a vandal or anything. I participated, and I don't see it fair that you say four editors were in the war, it was well more. jan€₣ 

It was stated above that while other editors were making edits to the page those edits were not what contributed to the conflict that caused the page to be protected. And regarding your issues with Elkman and your block, I don't see an issue there. Tiptoey blocked you and Nikki311 (upon your request) evaluated your block and found it justified.   Matt  

I'm moving the discussion  so that other contributors can edit in peace (Matt, your comment  please). jan€₣ 

You're suggesting that you move the discussion regarding this article off of the articles talkpage?   Matt  

Yes because as you see this thing is getting heated up, it would cause a bad impression. jan€₣ 

Definitely not. Discussion goes HERE, this is the talkpage, not a page is your userpage.   

Oh god there are more rules here than in Naziland (Germany in WWII). Anyway, lets see, let's reach a consensus here. Now, we unblock the page, and if a user fires up a war, let he be blocked, not the page. My issues with Elkman started in april and it was all a mistake (Contact me Elkman). Let's say that almost everyone warred, that's that, and reach the consensus I suggested. jan€₣ 

And the thread is Godwinned. Anyway, the policy is not for an immediate ban. An editor is to be warned and a ban may result if the editor in question does not stop the behavior they received the warning for.   Matt  

Yah, but they weren't even warned, just because I vandalized a page about 8M ago it dosen't mean I can't turn a new leaf. jan€₣

 Block 

You declined to block me for vandalism as you determined it was a content dispute, however it is barely a content dispute. The other user who reported me is entering information from a silly top 100 list into music articles as some type of """"award"""" or """"achievement"""" for the article topic. However the author of the list states that the list was chosen arbitrarily and with bias. The other user has been informed of this and simply ignores it and also blanks their page to hide any mention of it, while continuing to revert the information back into the articles (around 100 different articles) As a result I don't believe this to be a content dispute. I took this issue to the reliable references board to try and get some help but there was no one available to review it as the reference is written in Japanese (even though I made it easy to cross check without knowing Japanese) The Rolling Stone magazine in question is viewable here www.amazon.co.jp/Rolling-Stone-ローリング・ストーン-2007年-09月号/dp/B000UCGUXY/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt and on the cover of the magazine where it says """"BEST 100"""" in English, above that is the following sentence 独断と偏見で選んだ written in green just below the purple line as a disclaimer. A google translate will show it means """"chosen arbitrarily and with prejudice"""", and it is also written in the description section on the product page.

How do we find reliable sources that makes this kind of distinction?

Focus on Search Box When Main Page Loads
Is there any way someone can change the main page so that when it is first loaded, the insertion point is already blinking in the """"Search"""" box (like, for example, when you go to Google).  It would mean that the moment a person loaded the page, they could type what they're looking for.  It's an encyclopedia, so the search box should have a little more priority, don't you think?  The fact that it takes an extra click to get to the search box suggests that the main page is primarily a """"click-thru"""" page to other content.

Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[2]...

2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a """"country"""" (example). The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a """"province"""" (UK: example; NI: example) or a """"region"""" (UK: example; NI: example). Regardless of the choice of term, it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective:
 """"One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government."""" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford
 """"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change."""" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter
 """"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'."""" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, its population was 1,685,000, constituting between a quarter and a third of the island's total population and about 3% of the population of the United Kingdom.


Snowded, what is it that you find incorrect about this? The phrasing used is verbatium copy of how Northern Ireland is described on that 10 Downing Street webpage you keep wheeling out:""""Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom...""""

""""Alternatively, a saver could entrust their money with a bank for investment in the full-reserve equivalent of time deposits or savings accounts, which in a full reserve system would represent loans made to the bank rather than deposits.[1]""""

A deposit in a bank is by definition a loan to the bank, even though most people do not realise they are investors in a banks profit making operations.

Also the article is getting mixed up by the true nature of a fractional reserve bank.   A fractional reserve bank does not have sufficient on hand liquid assets to enable customers who have lent money to the bank to be paid out in a timely manner unless a buyer can be found for the illiquid loan book or loans can be secured against the loan book.

The bank of amsterdam was a warehouse bank.  You paid money to have your money stored at the bank.
the warehouse bank that lends customers savings money on term deposit still has the same problems if the loans go bad because it is in fact operating with fractional reserve.  The loans mean either deposits are created at the same bank or term savers money is no longer at the bank.  Either way you get two claims on the same money.  1. by the saver and 2 by the money user.

If the bank fails then somebody ends up with less money.

Deleting the Defense Side of the Story Will Violate NPOV and BLP

I don't agree with the way this is transpiring at all. This new proposed substituted article is highly POV, and was drafted behind closed doors by editors who all agree with one another. Meanwhile, there is unwelcoming treatment of those who do not hold similar views. All editing should be done out in the open, with fair and equal opportunity for everyone to participate. That means, editing should be done on the article page, not some page that people clicking on here don't know about. This is not a procedure that is consistent with the Wiki policy of having articles open for everyone in the world to participate in. 

No one group """"owns"""" this article or Wikipedia. By removing almost all the info that supports the defense side of the story, the proposed article is now unbalanced. The reader will come away with the view that A and R are certainly guilty, although that is disputed by thousands of people and no final determination of guilt or innocence has been made. The substituted article in no way complies with NPOV or BLP. I have contacted the Wikipedia Foundation because what is going on is in no way consistent with the rules and polices of Wikipedia. I have contributed financially to Wikipedia on the basis that all editors can contribute to an article, and that basic policies like NPOV and BLP are to be followed. But it seems that things are just getting worse and worse and worse with these efforts to block out the defense side of the story, and now also trying to block any other information about Amanda Knox from being included in other articles on the website, and trying to get those with other opinions blocked or banned. There needs to be compliance with NPOV, BLP and basic fairness and respect for those with other views.  """,0,0,0

"""The problem with saying that Warren G. Harding was the first African-American President is that it is a theory that is unproven by fact.  While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:
1) Harding's alleged """"black"""" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.

2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged """"black blood"""", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).

3) Harding was not raised as a cultural """"black"""" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.

4) """"Black Harding"""" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   

5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's """"blackness"""" on """"family stories"""".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.

6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the """"reviews"""" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black """"Black Harding"""" myth.

If Wikipedia were to add information that Harding was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation.
